06/30/2013,Data collection by Luke and Alex Pederson and Rob and Marshall Burgess
05/05/2014,A light overcast- light wind- gently ripping surface- (surprisingly) water level was about a foot below normal/average.  Robins- sparrows- female cardinal- crows were spotted.  No deer sited but lots of deer tracks along the banks.  Scoutmaster Spencer Kromrie and Boy Scout Reiley Hofschulte assisted.  
05/18/2014,Perception on Sunday listed as 3 due to excessive sediments making lake look very brown (not algae).  We've been having lots of rain.  Heavy rains on Monday really added to the brown and lake level is now above normal.  It appears water level increased two fee in two days on little lake Wissota.
06/01/2014,Checking in between rains.  Helpers: Robbie Gumness- Reiley Hofschulte- Hunter Kaan- Pat Hayes and Spencer Kromrie.
06/16/2014,thin overcast- light wind- lots of rain recently (3").  Lawns and trees are very green.  First monitoring session where small green particles are visible in the water.  Two curious birds that resemble female cardinals but have differences and seem to be mates hunting for food along the shoreline.  Water level normal meaning up about a foot from past sessions this season.
Helpers: Pat Hayes- Alex Schmocker- Devin Hall and Hunter Kann.    
06/27/2014,Overcast- recent rain- light breeze on lake.  Best visibily- at his sight- this season.  Volunteers: Pat- Dave- Reiley + Hunter.   
07/12/2014,Volunteers: Von Wolff- Ryan Wolff- Robert Gumness- Logan Kurtenbach and Dave Linse
07/26/2014,Lots of kids jumping off bridge- swimming and enjoying our wonderful lake.  Algae not bothering them a bit during a warm/hot summer day.  See 7-26-2014 for additional comments for today's three sites.
08/26/2014,Water actually appears a bit better than the last monitoring on 8-10-14.  
09/13/2014,This water is much clearer than Stillson Creek- again.  There's about 75% less algae "sprigs" in the water- too.  Unike Stillson Creek and the Yellow River on the north east side of Big Wissota- we see No blooms on the surface.
