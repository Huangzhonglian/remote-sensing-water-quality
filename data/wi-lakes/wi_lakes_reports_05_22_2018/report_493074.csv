Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
08/12/2012,First data entry- as a small lake association.  We are excited to be part of the monitoring project.  The team will be Diane Gluth- Cass Carty and Randy Herman- all officers of the Paulson Lake Association.
08/20/2012,Second measure- with Cass- Diane and Randy all on board to measure.  
08/28/2012,Diane and Cass completed monitoring session #3.  Warm sunny afternoon with moderate SE breeze after late morning thunderstorm.
09/05/2012,Diane and Cass completed monitoring session #4.  Sunny and warm afternoon with light breeze.  Due to lack of recent rain- shoreline has visibly receded and lake level down.  Some days of rain would be helpful.
09/13/2012,Diane and Cass completed monitoring session #5.  Sunny afternoon in upper 60s with moderate NW breeze and light whitecaps- after off and on light rain the previous day.  More rain would be good for the lake.
