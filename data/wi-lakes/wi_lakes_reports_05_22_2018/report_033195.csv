Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
06/13/2002,Heavy weeds for this time of year.

    
06/22/2002,Very Weedy

    
06/25/2002,Weeds worse. South End hard to navigate

    
07/01/2002,Excessive weed growth - Sunny hot weather for 3 days in the 90s    
07/07/2002,Some of the weeds maturing- lake looks better

    
07/24/2002,South end very weedy..  There has been a beaver dam at South end of lake all summer and the water has been high as a result    
07/31/2002,Excessive weed growth.   Alk Test at 124 ppm    
08/10/2002,Weeds maturing.  So thick nearly stopping pontoon boat

    
08/19/2002,Weeds are a real problem at south end.

    
09/10/2002,Weeds have been worse than I can remember ever ever
seen them....  I've been on this lake for lots of years.

    
09/24/2002,Weeds are dying and dropping down but are still so
thick you can run a motor any where on the South end of the lake.

    
10/18/2002,Very high water due to beaver dams; almost brown color
water-  cold- rainy and windy.    
05/03/2003,Early start on weed problems
    
05/16/2003,Early start to weed problems
    
05/29/2003,West Shore is weed ridden... very bad
    
06/02/2003,Still very weedy
    
06/17/2003,More weed free than before.   Don't understand why the
water clarity increased by three feet since last time....
    
07/07/2003,Water levels are high because of beavers daming the
exit stream... they have built their dam another six inches higher than last year.   No apparent problems have resulted from the high water... may
have even improved fishing.
