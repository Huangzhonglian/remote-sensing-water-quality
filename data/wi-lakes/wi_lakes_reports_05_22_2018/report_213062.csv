Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
06/01/2015,Heavy rain last several days.Beaver activity causing water level to rise.  Level up 2-3 inches based on boat dock distance from water.
06/16/2015,Lots of rain.  Beaver activity continues.  Most boat docks touching water.  Loons present since ice out.  No signs of nest.
06/27/2015,Boater looking for loon nest.  No loon chicks sighted. 

07/05/2015,Many careless boaters motoring close to shore.  Persons in Kayak probing every inch of shore looking for wildlife.  little regard for waterfowl.
07/27/2015,Some minor particulate in water
08/13/2015,None
08/27/2015,One adult loon spotted.  Some boat activity.
09/12/2015,None
09/23/2015,None
10/07/2015,Bottom is 10.25 feet.  No boating activity on lake.  Ice out was on 4/10/2015.  Not certain if this date can be entered online.  No loons this year.  Have had loons past four years.  My guess was the water level changing frequently causing nest failure.  I plan to install 15" pipes through dams next year to regulate water level.
06/29/2016,Loon pair not nesting again this year.  lake level more constant due to reduced Beaver activity.  
07/04/2016,minor debris from 4 July activities.
07/16/2016,Aquatic plant beds seem larger than usual.  Not invasive Aquatic vegetation.
09/14/2016,bottom of lake can be seen.  very clear.
06/04/2017,ice out first week of april
06/12/2017,1.6" rain last evening
06/21/2017,lots of rain again
06/30/2017,Beaver activity on Round Creek.
07/08/2017,Aggressive Eagle activity and or drastic level changes possible reason Round Lake had Loon nesting failure again. 
09/08/2017,Cool day.  Occasional loon sighted.  Wondering if ANP for loons would be helpful.  Several rentals on lake.  All season folks disturbed waterfowl nesting areas.
