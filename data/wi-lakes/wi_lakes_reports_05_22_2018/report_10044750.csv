Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
07/19/2016,SWF sediment sample collected via Ekman dredge. Sample was a half gallon of extremely fine sediments- so multi-stage processing was necessary (examining material screened through 500 um mesh- then liquid portion through 150 um mesh- then subsamples of remaining fine sediments through 150 um mesh.) 7 aliquots examined.
