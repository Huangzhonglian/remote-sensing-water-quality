Temperature of water column at depth of 40 ft.  was 45.6 degrees F.
10/18/2007,Air temperature 50 deg. F.- several killing frosts- lake appears to be turning over...interesting note regarding temperature:  temperature at depth of 40 ft. on 9/17/07 consistently has been 45.6 degrees F.  Temperature at depth of 40 ft. on 10/18/07 was 55.2 degrees F.  Geese beginning to congregate on the lake...fish not in normal places in SE Bay..not present.  Lake still down some 10-12 inches from normal summer levels. 
05/28/2008,Sunny an calm.  Temperature was 63 degrees.  Helped by my wife Bev.
  Weather was sunny with a slight breeze.  Wolf Lake seemed to have good clarity for this time of the year.  Pumpkinseeds (sunfish) and largemouth bass were on the spawning beds and crappies were almost finished.  Bluegills were still in deeper water.  The migratory songbirds have arrived including indigo buntings and a sighting of a scarlet tanager.  The area around Wolf Lake has a good population of deer and wild turkey.  I was assisted by my wife Bev.
06/25/2008,At time of sampling there were high clouds and a temperature of 71 degrees.  The lake experienced 9.5 inches of rain since the May sampling date.  An acceptable amount of lake weeds were noticed and the lake was just spot treated for Eurasian water-milfoil.  Some largemouth bass still in shallow water as were some  sunfish.  Bluegills starting to move off their spawning beds.  Abundant wildlife including a nesting pair of bald eagles.  Assisted with the sampling by my wife- Bev.  Zebra Mussel substrate set out on June 24 at 11:00 A.M.
07/23/2008,Weather was sunny with some high clouds.  Air temperature at the start of monitoring was 68.5 degrees with low humidity.  Abundant wildlife in the vicinity of Wolf Lake including a pair of nesting bald eagles .  All spawning appears to be finished although some large panfish are still in the shallows.  Assisted in the monitoring by my wife- Bev.  Upper zebra mussel substrate examined on July 24 .  No zebra mussels were found.  Zebra mussel substrate is suspended from the second boat pier to the north of the public boat landing.
08/26/2008,Weather was sunny and clear-slight breeze- and low humidity.  Air temperature at the start of monitoring was 69 degrees.  Continued abundant wildlilfe in the vicinity of Wolf Lake.  Panfish- with the exception of small panfish- seem to be in 10 to 15 feet of water.  Upper zebra mussel substrate examined on Aug. 22.  No zebra mussels were found.  Zebra mussel substrate is suspended from the second boat pier to the north of the public boat landing. 
09/25/2008,The above end date reflects the removal of zebra mussel substrates.  No zebra mussels found on either substrate.  Weather was sunny with some very high clouds and air temperature on the lake was 70 degrees.  Some bass in the shallows along with small panfish.  Larger panfish (bluegills and crappies) in approximately 15' of water.  Wildlife still abundant with some early migratory birds spotted.  The lake was recently checked for Eurasian milfoil with no spot treatment necessary.  Assisted with the lake monitoring with my wife- Bev.
05/20/2009,Clear- sunny and breezy morning.  Air temp. of 64 degrees at start of monitoring.  The spring bird migration is well underway and sandhill cranes have paired up.  Unfortunately tent caterpillars are established in the area.  A nesting pair of bald eagles are once again on Wolf Lake.  Largemouth bass are in the shallows and panfish are in about 8 - 12 feet of water.  Other wildlife (deer and wild turkeys) are well established around the lake.  Assisted by my wife - Bev- with the monitoring.
06/25/2009,Weather was warm and humid (72 degrees at 8:00 A.M.) with high clouds .  Monitoring period was followed by short period of light rain.  Bluegills  and sunfish are spawning and largemouth bass are still in shallow water.  Wildlife is abundant (deer- turkey- sandhill cranes) with recent black bear sightings.  We are currently trying to positively ID pickeral which have been seen by several people -including myself- while on the lake.  This will be updated in future "Comments".
07/26/2009,The temperature at the time of monitoring was 77.5 degrees F. and the sky was partly cloudy and breezy.  The secchi  disc reading was compromised by ripples on the lake and by the fact that clouds blocked the sun making the depth determination difficult.  The phosphorus and chlorophyl A samples were stored in the refridgerator and freezer respectively before being mailed the next day.  No more spawning activity observed and fish have moved to deeper water.  Typical wildlife observed in the area (including resident eagles).  I was assissted by my wife Bev with the monitoring.
08/25/2009,High overcast at start of sampling with a temperature of 67 degrees.  Somewhat breezy.  Thunderstorms rolled through the area about three hours after the sampling was completed.  Typical wildlife in the area (turkeys and sandhill cranes) but the deer still seem somewhat illusive.  I was assisted by my wife Bev with the monitoring.
09/16/2009,High clouds with a slight breeze.  Wolf Lake- although not at a low level- is at it's lowest level of the monitoring season.  The month of September through the 16th has been without any rain and the temperatures have been warm.  Fishing has been slow but Northern Pike have been hitting just before dusk.  The lake will be inspected for Eurasion Water Milfoil on September 18th.  Many Sandhill Cranes and Wild Turkeys in the area.  I was assisted by my brother-in-law- Jim Anderson- with the monitoring.  
05/22/2010,Weather was partly cloudy- breezy- and the temperature was 67 degrees.  Typical wildllife in the area including turkeys and sandhill cranes.  Migratory song birds moving through with a good population of natives (woodpeckers- nuthatches- and bluejays).  Deer population seems not as abundant in the immediate area.
Bass and blugills have recently started spawning.
Assissted with the monitoring by my wife Bev.

06/27/2011,Cloudy with an air temperature of 67 degrees.  Moderate breeze and cloudy sky resulted in some difficuly with the secchi disc reading.  Almost all fish are off the spawning beds and are returning to deeper water.  I was assisted with the lake monitoring by lake area resident Jim Anderson. Cloudy with an air temperature of 67 degrees.  Moderate breeze and cloudy sky resulted in some difficuly with the secchi disc reading.

07/25/2011,Sunny with a slight breeze.  Air temperature on the lake at the sampling site was 77.7 degrees.  A very nice morning.  Normal wildlife in the area.  Sandhill Crane chicks are growing.  Fishing has not been that good with the arrival of hot and humid weather.  My wife Bev was my additional helper this morning.    
08/31/2011,Partly cloudy with a slight breeze from the east.  Air temp. at the time of monitoring was 72.6 dgrees.  Altogether a very nice morning.  Typical wildlife in the area.

06/10/2013,Air Temp. - 78.0 degrees F.  The lake had been chemically treated for 
  EWM on June 7 using the whole lake method.  
07/21/2013,Mostly cloudy with a slight easterly breeze.  Air temperature was 70.8 degrees.  Monitoring and sampling was completed before thunderstorms entered the area around 1:30 P.M.  First cooler day after a week of hot and humid weather.  Assisted by lake resident Jim Anderson.  
03/22/2014,air temp in mid 40s F--lake very quiet--boat launch in terrible shape--no one else on the lake
07/15/2014,Windy and unseasonably cool with mostly cloudy skies.  Because of windy conditions it was difficult to position over the deep hole in the lake.  There was no chemical treatment for EWM on Wolf Lake this year.  Assisted by my wife Bev this morning.
