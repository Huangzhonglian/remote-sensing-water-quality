07/17/2006,overcast- calm- midge larvae exuvae on water surface
08/03/2006,rain this a.m.; 10% cloud cover; white caps
08/30/2006,white caps- midge exuvae all over water surface- small planktonic algae visible
07/16/2008,Lake Koshkonong was sampled on 7/16/2008 by Michael Sorge and Cami Peterson.  Water levels on the lake are or were still 2-3 feet higher than normal due to the rainfall in June and July.  Air temp was 79degree F- winds were 5-7mph WSW.  Cloud cover was 80%- humidity was high.  Water was clear with some blue green algae present.  Secchi Depth was 1.5 feet.
08/13/2008,Mostly sunny- 75 degrees F.
Water depth: 5.4 feet.
Secchi disk: 1.8 feet
Water level is still slightly high for this time of year.  Water is green and murky- with some filamentous algae.
08/09/2011,extremely high winds and large waves made it very difficult to get an accurate temp/DO profile reading. We were only able to get a 1m integrated sample for phosphorus and chlorophyll due to shallow depth and large waves.
04/30/2013,corrected air temperature units to F- and added data collector on 12/27/2013 SG
07/16/2013,Cloud cover about 50%; Wind 5mph; Air temp 89F; Heavy algal bloom- like grass clippings in single pieces and clumps. 
08/27/2013,Air temp 88F- wind 12mph; Algal bloom throughout lakefrom boat launch to area sampled.Cloudcover was thin and wispy- water was rough with whitecaps. It was difficult to judge depth due to boat bouncing in waves. 
05/28/2014,lake levels normal to slightly high. Pelicans flying overhead. Cloud cover 40%- Wind 3mph. Air temperature 63F. 
07/23/2014,Cloud cover 75%. Winds 15mph. Air 75F. Algae that looks like grass clippings present. 
08/18/2014,Clouds 75%. Wind 5-7mph. Air temp 80. Grass clipping algae present. Seemed that water levels were low - difficultly finding deep hole (or even a hole deep enough to put down the 2m integrated sampler). 
09/26/2014,Difficult to find 6ft depth. Volunteer: Dan Aragon. Tons of algae in water. Cloud cover 0%. Wind 0-3mph. Air temp 72F. 
05/28/2015,Ron Anderson (CLMN volunteer) assisted. Beautiful weather- sunny- clear- very busy boat landing. About 78F. 50% cloud cover- wind 0-5mph. Water meal present. 
07/07/2015,Smoke from Canada! 
Blue green algae (grass clipping one) present. Whitecaps. Clouds 95%- wind 10-15mph- air temp 65F. No profiles taken- too rough for probe to stabilize. 
08/06/2015,30% cloud cover- wind 0-5mph. Air approx. 70F. Lake very low and murky. 
09/09/2015,Clarity was unbelievable. We could see to the bottom easily from the boat launch until we got beyond depths of 3 plus feet. Beautiful clear weather (cloud cover 20%) with very light breeze (about 3mph). Air temp not recorded but comfortable warm. We couldn't find a depth at 6' or greater so used the Van Dorn sampler.
06/03/2016,Surprising number of boats for a Friday morning; lot nearly full
Cloud cover:  60%
wind speed:  9 mph south
Air temp:  75 degrees F
Visible- but no clumping algae
07/27/2016,Cloud cover 10%- Wind 2mph- air temp 84 F Cloud cover 10%- Wind 2mph- air temp 84 F; Water sample was by hand grab. DO meter not calibrated before monitoring.
Spiny waterflea sample was collected with Ekman dredge method. 6 aliquots examined - sample was primarily very fine sediments that passed through sieve- with few plant fragments and little organic debris.
08/10/2016,Hand grab water sample at 1 foot. Depth 6 feet at sample site.DO meter not calibrated before monitoring
08/24/2016,Sample depth 0-2 meters with integrated sampler (1 meter) Data Collector: Kevin Olson with Rebecca Williams Secchi depth was 9 inches Depth 6'7" at 42.87824- -88.95778 updated by Jeanne Scherer on 12/272016 
07/17/2017,Additional collector: Kevin Olson
07/31/2017,No DO profile due to meter reading negative values
Collectors: Amanda Smith- Kevin Olson
