05/24/2004,DEEP HOLE - GRAB    
08/16/2004,DEEP HOLE - INTEGRATED SAMPLE    
08/14/2007,Lake has two very different sections: one shallow with lots of native vegetation; other deep with native vegetation close to the shore.  Steep shoreline.
06/18/2009,Loons Spotted
Out with Maureen Ferry and Bill Scaife
05/19/2010,Partly cloudy- slight breeze.
Volunteer- Bill Scaife
Additional data collectors- Maureen Ferry- Mari Dalapiazza
1 Loon sighted- Bald Eagle nest sighted.
06/29/2011,Weather- Sunny and Calm
Native Vegetation- very diverse- w.shield- diverse pondweeds (ft.leaf-L.leaf.Illinois...)
Wildlife Observed- Loon + 2 chicks- muskrat- Bald eagle nest (1 adult 2 juveniles) 
recent heavy rains + wind- low secchi data
clarity reading north end of the lake (13.25 secchi)
one loon still on nest- one with young loon- another adults swimming
native plants are very diverse- outlet is area of interest for ZM surveys
