As I was completeing the testing they seemed have come closer to the pontoon. Then one after the other three of them took off- however- never really going fully airborne as they seemed to have just moved further away.  Water level has come up noticable due to the significant rain fall we have received here in Sawyer County recently Per the Sawyer County Record Paper- 7.26 inches fell in July and we received well over 4 inches in a heavy rain storm Saturday night (8/7).
FYI- One thing that is very noticeable this summer is the amount of purple loosestrife in bloom.  Along the roads near our flowage and in the bogs and bays it has really become noticeable compared to last year.  Our Lake Assn does have several members (ourselves included) raising beetles to help fight the spread.  We have now positioned the beetles in various places throught the flowage. Not sure if it is enough
