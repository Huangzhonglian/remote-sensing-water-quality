07/08/2008,Assume noon for the time. Assume that temperature and dissolved oxygen profile was taken at the deep hole. 
10/04/2016,Breezy and fair amount of cloud cover- not ideal conditions for secchi but training session with Sandy Wickman. Participants were Rick Green- Rick Wollerman- Bill Cerny- Gary Gruca- and Fritz Behr.  
10/24/2016,Cloudless- beautiful- crisp day- ideal for secchi reading.  Assisted by Margaret Behr.  Spotted two immature loons and adult eagle in new nest.
04/22/2017,Eagles have built a new nest on "Virgin Island" since last Fall and were observed on the nest.  Also observed one loon pair. Data collected by Gary Gruca and Fritz Behr
05/14/2017,Observed loon and eagle on nest.
06/01/2017,Satellite day.  Observed loon and eagle on nest.  Perfect day for secchi.
06/09/2017,Loon chick is MIA- baby eagle sticking head above nest- smallmouth bass on nests. Good day for secchi.   Assisted by Margaret Behr

09/21/2017,Satellite day.  Sechhi reading by Bill Cerny. 
09/25/2017,Collected water sample to be analyzed for lead- mercury- conductivity- alkalinity- hardness- and pH. Sample collection assisted by Gary Gruca. Results - conductivity: 24.2 uS/cm- pH: 6.92- alkalinity: 6.52 mg/L- calcium: 15.9 mg/L- magnesium: 5.86 mg/L- hardness: 63.9 mg/L- lead: ND- mercury: ND.
