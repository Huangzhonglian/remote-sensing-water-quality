05/31/2009,cloudy- windy
08/19/2009,ANOTHER READING THIS DATE WAS NOT CORRECT.  IT WAS 4.5 FEET AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN 1.2 FEET.
08/23/2009,WATER CLEARED FROM 1.2' TO 4.2' READING IN A WEEK.  HAD ABOUT 1/5 - 2" RAIN BETWEEN READINGS.
06/24/2010,water clarity reading increased 8' since last reading.  Algae die off probably due to many cloudy days.  Could see most of the bottom around the lake.
