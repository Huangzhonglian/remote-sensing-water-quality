The spring and much of the summer have been very wet and below average cold.  Lake level is as high as I've seen in ten years here and and high as any of the 'old timers' can remember.  The drainage culvert has been flowing out since mid-April at an estimated 200+ gallons per minute- but the flow out has not kept up with the rain so the lake level has actually risen since the culvert was opened.
07/13/2017,Lake level at record level 
07/20/2017,No rain for several days now- but lake level is still as high as ever in-spite of the drain culvert's steady out flow of water.
