Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
07/19/2017,Coordinate listed on SWIMS was not deep enough for deep hole. Sample and data were collected very near dam in about 4.5 ft. of water.
08/02/2017,No DO profile because probe is reading negative values.
Additional helpers: Kevin Olson
Only 4.4 ft. at 43.33453- -89.95161
Water sample only take from 0-4ft.
08/16/2017,Sample taken from 0-3 ft. with integrated sampler.
