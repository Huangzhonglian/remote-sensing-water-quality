Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
07/31/1979,Migrated from EPA STORET Legacy Database- originally reported by Wisconsin DNR    
05/03/1994,Taylor lake has a bad area where the run-off from king veterans home comes in.  Assumed sample time was noon.    
09/22/1994,It rained the night of the 21st and was raining when readings were made on the 22nd.    
05/23/2016,mid-week
06/29/2016,Mostly clear- temperatures in the 80s.
07/20/2016,Sunday
08/14/2016,Very busy Sunday afternoon- low 80s- partly cloudy.
09/11/2016,Late day Sunday- low 70s- clear to partly cloudy and windy.
10/11/2016,Mid week- 70 degree range- clear.  Windy.  Lakes appreciating lack of boat traffic.
06/01/2017,Beautiful late Spring day- clear skies- temps in the uppers 70's- moderate winds.  Tests taken by myself and my husband- Bob Wells.
07/24/2017,The lake was very stirred up- we purpusfuly waited a day to let the water settle down before testing.  The day was perfect.  Very little boat traffic- clear skies- light breeze air temp around 80.  The results came back bad- these lakes are to abused and overcrowded and it showed to obviously with this set of tests.  Wild life is disappearing- the loons we had all Spring have now moved away.  Small batches of geese and ducks- with very few babies.  The clarity of the water was poor- our once beautiful water looked not so healthy yesterday.                                                 
08/28/2017,Lake was not coming along as far as color and clarity as we had hoped it would be- very little improvement in clarity.  More of a darker green detected.  These lakes can't take this abuse.  Loons have been gone now for over a month- only an occasional sighting- used to be several times daily- the loons lived on Sunset and Rainbow Lakes until approx. the 4th of July- that is when the boating population went out of control.  To many boats- to big of boats allowed- wave action tearing the shores apart- very sad to see and none of the organizations affiliated with the lakes will do a thing.  So very sad
09/30/2017,Beautiful- clear fall day.  Temp in the mid 60's.  The lakes are not clearing up as quickly as I had hoped- maybe due to the wonderful warm weather and continued moderate use of the Chain.  My husband- Bob Wells helped with the testing and a friend- Brett Wilke had his first experience doing the temperatures.
