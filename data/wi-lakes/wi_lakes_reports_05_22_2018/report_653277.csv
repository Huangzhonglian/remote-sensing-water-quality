02/14/1980,15 inches ice.
05/05/2004,DEEP HOLE NEAR DAM     
08/03/2004,DEEP HOLE @ 8FT NEAR DAM     
09/26/2006,2 inches of rain fell between Sept. 26th and October 7th.
08/03/2008,Excessive floating vegetation.  Hard to boat in many places.
09/05/2008,Had 1.5 inches of rain yesterday after long dry period.  
Carol McCormick assistend with data collection and processing.
05/19/2009,Carol McCormick helped
06/20/2009,3 inches of rain June 19-20.  Depth of hole- 8.25 ft.
07/23/2009,very little rain since 6/20 only 1.5" .  Very weedy.
07/27/2009,DO results for our 3 ft. sample seem out of whack.  We may have spilled some sample or done something wrong.
08/23/2009,Carol McCorming helped.  Clear weather- unseasonably cool.  Good rain lately.  Lots of floating weeds.  We spilled our 3 ft. sample for DO and our 6 ft. sample had lots of sediment which may have tainted  the result.
05/22/2010,Water is clear but lots of floating decomposed matter in shallow areas.  Bad smell.

05/31/2010,Lots of floating and blooming vegetation.  Rotted gassy matter that was floating 2 wks ago has mostly sunk or passed through.
06/09/2010,Weeds obscured the secchi disk somewhat.
07/01/2010,Lots of floating vegetation and bad smell.  Many dragonflies this year.
08/19/2010,Vegetation has grown up and closed the area where Whitewater Creek enters Trippe Lk.  I am quite sure it is wild rice- blackbirds are feeding.  I have never seen this channel closed up like this.
08/24/2010,Took duplicate and blank samples today for quality control.
04/09/2011,Lake was about 90% ice-free by March 20- 2011.  Fisherman were catching many bluegill from February until ice-out.
05/15/2011,Assisted by Aidan Coburn.  Very windy- cool.  Last rain was .5 inch on May 12.
06/03/2011,Very active carp.  Clouded water in shallow areas.
06/12/2011,Temp cooled to ~ 60  after a few days in the 90's.  Floating weeds and scum in bays and shallows.  Very clear water.
06/16/2011,Beautiful day.  Some floating weeds but clear water.  Two large white egrets flying and feeding.
06/26/2011,Sunny and 68.  Bullfrog seen- green frog heard.
07/18/2011,Very hot weather.  Saw pair of kingfishers and heard sandhill cranes.  Floating decaying matter- floating weeds.  Water clear.
08/29/2011,Assisted by Aidan Coburn- age 9.  Very weedy- floating decomposed vegetation.  No mosquitoes this season.  Several fishermen today.
10/03/2011,Assisted by Steve Hanson.  Saw many mud turtles.  Sunny mild weather.  
03/24/2012,Ice out early by March 15.  Heard chorus frogs on Mar. 14th. First robin and redwing blackbird on March 1st.  
05/20/2012,No rain for 15 days.  Clear water.  Carp and bass being taken.  Fewer goslings than usual due to new depredator permit on the lake.  No rain for 15 days.  Clear water.  Carp and bass being taken.  Fewer goslings than usual due to new depredator permit on the lake. 
06/19/2012,Little rain lately- lots of decaying floating vegetation- unpleasant smell.
07/07/2012,Drought conditions- no rain since 6/14- several days of 95+ heat.  Saw many dead fish- 14 northern pike ranging from 15" to about 25"- many dead carp- 0 dead bass- 0 bluegill.  Not that many northern are taken on this lake- so possibly a good proportion- even most- are dying off.  Assume from lack of oxygen.  Many floating weeds and dead vegetation.  Large water lily (Nelumbo nucifera I think) has been in our pond for about 5 years; it is spreading outward and dying out at center. 
08/16/2012,Due to thick vegetation at the deep hole- I couldn't see the secchi disk below about 4 feet.  I suspect the true clarity was very high- even up to 7-8 feet.  For the same reason- I couldn't obtain a 6 ft. sample with my Van Dorn sampler.
09/22/2012,Secchi disk was still visible when obscured by weeds near the bottom.
06/21/2013,Lake was treated with DMA-4 and Tirbune for EWM and navigation on June 17th per City of Whitewater permit.
07/13/2014,Had almost 3 inches of rain last night.  Algae and floating weeds are down somewhat.
06/24/2015,Assisted by Kate Coburn.  Weed harvesting one 3 days ago.  Much floating decaying matter.  City of Whitewater is planning to ask for DNR assessment and cost of dredging.
08/21/2017,Assisted by John Pio.  Eclipse day- it was fading by 2:30.  RE: water temp- for the last 2 dates- I have been using the thermometer on the Van Dorn sampler because my digital quit working.
