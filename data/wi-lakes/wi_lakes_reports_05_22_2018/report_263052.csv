07/24/2014,Beautiful day with sunny skies and calm water.  Cool temperature but warming.
08/20/2014,The lake was very calm- glassy.  Sky was overcast.  A pair of loons with twin chicks were nearby.  A little bit of pollen or algae floated in the water.
Water has receded about 18" in the last few weeks.  
08/27/2014,Partly cloudy- 66degrees- lake calm- pair of loons out. Lake is receding daily.
09/24/2014,The day was overcast- windy- with waves.  Only saw one loon.
04/27/2015,Outside temperature was in the high 40's.  It was sunny and rather windy so the lake was choppy.Earlier this morning there were three trumpeter swans on the main body of Trude.  We have at least six pairs of loon on Trude.  Ofsprey nesting on east end of the lake.  Same nest that had hatchlings last year.
Jeff and Leann Malison have helped with the sampling and observations of ice out.
06/11/2015,Dragonflies have been out for a good week- mayflies are just hatching.  It's overcast today and very calm.  There is some pine pollen on the lake.
06/26/2015,Mostly sunny with some clouds. very calm.  72 degrees. Saw one loon. 
07/27/2015,Beautiful morning- sunny- very calm. Some visible pollen.  5 loons swimming together.
08/08/2015,Today was partly sunny- windy- and wavy.  There were 7 loons congregating.  The next day there were 10 loons together.
08/27/2015,The early morning started out very foggy.  By 10:00 am the skies had clear- sunny- with some haze. The water was very calm.  There was an eagle-several seagulls- and 3 loons. The loons separated and then one started going towards another one and it was making a soft wheezing sound I had never heard from a loon before.  It followed the other loon for a bit and the other loon took off to another part of the lake.  The loon continued making the wheezing sound and meandered off.
The water level has been dropping considerably the last two weeks. Approximately 1-2 feet.
04/29/2016,Lake was calm- mostly sunny skies.  Wind did pick up while collecting data and water sample..  Pair of loon on the lake.  Jeff and Leann Malison were kind enough to take me out on their pontoon as our piers and boats aren't in yet.  
06/29/2016,Beautiful partly cloudy morning with a breeze building.  There is just a little pollen noticeable in the lake.  No loons are visible- only two fishing boats on the lake.
07/19/2016,Partly cloudy with a light breeze and about 78 degrees.  A pair of loons were in our bay as we took off for testing.  There were 5 fishing boats out on the lake which is unusual.  One was motor trolling.
07/26/2016,Beautiful- partly cloudy day with a strong breeze.  Very little action on the lake- only 1 fishing boat out.  Heard but did not see loons.

In the past on the recording of the Secchi Disk I have always checked that the water color was brown and that it was clear. In the main part of the manual for secchi monitoring it didn't state to record clear water as "blue".  I just happened to read through appendix 1:  Where it states that clear water should be recorded as "blue".  So- from now on I will follow that point. Sorry for the confusion.
08/08/2016,Today is partly cloudy and breezy.  There are several loons on the lake- a few sea gulls and only one fishing boat.  A rather quiet day.
08/30/2016,Mostly cloudy day with a slight breeze.  There are a couple of fishing boats on the lake along with several seagulls- a pair of loons with twin chicks toward the east end of main area of Trude- another loon in the center area.  An eagle was sighted overhead.  Also- there are some  dead small flies from a recent hatch still floating in the lake. They were worse yesterday and the day before. 
09/15/2016,Beautiful sunny day- temp in low 60's. Few wispy clouds. Medium winds with waves at DeepHole but not white caps.  Only 1 fishing boat out today and a sea gull.  The loon that hangs out in our bay was there early this morning- but I did not see it this afternoon. It usually returns late afternoon.
04/22/2017,Beautiful sunny day.Very calm this morning with a pair of loons in our bay.  The wind picked up throughout the morning and by the time we went out on the boat it was rather windy and wavy.  One other boat on the lake.  Jeff Malison and Marty Burns were my helpers today.
06/09/2017,Mostly sunny day in the mid seventies with a slight breeze.  The dragonflies were out in force finally.  There were two fishing boats and one kayak on the lake at the time.  Also sighted were a pair of loons and an eagle. Slight pollen in the water.
06/27/2017,It was partly cloudy and a bit windy with moderate waves. I saw only 1 pontoon boat and 1 fishing boat out on the lake. The exciting event while out on the water was watching an eagle dive- scoop up something from the water- and go to the shoreline. It flew off shortly after.
07/11/2017,Beautiful calm day with a slight breeze and wispy clouds. There were two fishing boats and 5 loons on the main part of the lake.
07/27/2017,Beautiful morning with light breeze out of the east.  Very few clouds.  There were only two fishing boats observed while testing and one loon.
08/15/2017,Beautiful day on the lake under sun and blue skies with a slight breeze and little ripples of waves.  We were joined by a loon- a gull- and two jetskiers.  My helpers today were two of my grandchildren- Holden - 9 and Madelyn - 7.  They were very useful in observing- calling out the water temperature and recording.
08/28/2017,A mostly cloudy day with a light breeze and small ripples on the lake. There were three fishing boats out on the lake along with three loons and one seagull.  A several geese flew overhead. After two days of almost continuous rain- it was nice being able to get outside.
09/12/2017,Beautiful sunny- cloudless day.  There was a slight breeze with ripples over the lake.  Besides my husband and I there were three fishing boats- 1 loon- and 2 seagulls on the lake.  The leaves on the trees are starting to show their colors.  While checking the water temperature 3 more seagulls joined the other couple and a while later 2 more loons showed up. Just a great day to enjoy the lake.
