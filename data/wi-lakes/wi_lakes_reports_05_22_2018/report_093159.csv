06/27/2014,Overcast- morning rain- light breeze- baby ducks- turtles.

07/26/2014,84 degree air temp. Beautiful day- breezy- heavy boat traffic on lake.  Increased "algae sprigs" in all visible layers of the water- at all three Little Lake Wissota sites.  Algal blooms on surface increased.  Stillson Creek having the most.
