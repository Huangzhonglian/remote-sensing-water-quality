we had a HUGE number of carp that died off this spring. There were ~ 30-40 eagles spotted around the lake but they got sick of eating fish so 8 people who live on this lake collected ~ 1000 rotting carp and fertilized a local farmers field.  A lot of fish remained in the lake despite our efforts.
05/13/2011,calm and sunny water lever down quite a bit from last month.
07/08/2011,water level stays down despite adequate rainfall.  The dam downstream must be wide open draining out this lake!!

10/03/2011,calm / sunny
11/15/2011,sunny.  Lake water level continues to be quite low.

There was a lot of "new" plant growth seen this year in areas that I have never seen vegetation before.  Possibly because of the lack of carp
