08/06/2015,Ducks- geese- birds.  Helper Dave Worzalla-  Cloudy out  water terrible this summer- no swimming and hardly anyone using the water
06/20/2016,Emily from CLM accompanied us as did our daughter- Megan in the boat to obtain samples and duplicates for Quality control.  Lots of algae and it was very windy so hard for Dave to paddle our boat.  Emily was able to obtain other samples in the water for testing at her lab-.   
08/21/2016,We could not paddle our boat to the place we usually take samples because there was so much pond scum and algae.  Our boat could not make it through. Most of the summer was horrible for any type of kayaking or out boating.  We had to go to the public dock to take samples- which was close to where our usual sampling it taken.
09/29/2016,Finally from all the rain we could take our boat out for samples.  Very windy with some sun.  Lots of geese and ducks swimming which was nice to see.
