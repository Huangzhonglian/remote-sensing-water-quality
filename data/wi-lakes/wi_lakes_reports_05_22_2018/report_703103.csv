Eric Evensen- DNR Trainer was with training me today; he noted EWM floatables and removed them from deep hole- middle lake and near Evergreen boat launch. Eric stated that the Evergreen channel area looked  a lot better (less EWM) than last year. Eric also informed me that Evergreen owner had used a hose method to remove EWM in 2014.  Eric Evensen also noted that some "fish sticks" were removed on SW shore near new development area.


05/23/2015,Weather: Sunny + calm; Yellowish tree pollen noted on water surface intermittently along southern shoreline;II found what appeared to be one EWM floatable  and removed it from mid-lake; I spoke with lake property owners to confirm observation that water level is lower this year than last year. Diverse dragonfly population noted. Joe Guidote assisted me today.


06/03/2015,Weather: Sunny with slight breeze. Temperature:74F ; Wildlife observed: mallard pair- numerous birds and fish. I noted what appeared to be EWM floatables near Springwater resort. Several other types of aquatic plants floating in water today- but I am not sure of the types or names of what is present.  Weather: Sunny with slight breeze.
