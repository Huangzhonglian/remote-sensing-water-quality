07/13/2002,Of all the years taking measurements- this has been the lowest clarity reading for July that I have taken. Also found Zebra Mussels @ the small island. Partly cloudy/sunny with 5 mph breeze. Moderate boat traffic.    
08/03/2002,Quite a bit of jet ski and boating activity today. Sky was sunny and hazy. Breeze at 10 mph. Lake cleared up a lot since 7-13 reading. Found zebra mussels everywhere- attached to cattail roots- and snails. Cannot walk barefoot in lake anymore due to zebra mussels on shore. Increase in amount of snails on shore. More weed growth in lake. Was really pleased to see that there was hardly any algae on lake at this time.
