05/24/2010,No change in Secchi reading.  Temp-55- 5-8 mph breeze- sunny.  During the DO testing (Winkler Titration Method)- I noted unusual occurrence during "fixing" step on samples at 0+5 ft. After adding manganous sulfate/alkaline potassium iodide aside + mixing samples twice. Upon adding sulfuric acid and mixing- the samples had a considerable amount of suspended black sediment the size of sand particles. It took between 8-10 min of mixing/waiting for this precipitate to finally dissolve.  Even after this length of time- there were still miniscule traces of these particles left in both samples.  I did a 2nd test on all the samples to verify the results. The sample taken at 10' was similar in that it also had the black particles- but much less.  All 3 samples (0-5-10') were a dark clear straw color after adding sulfuric acid. 
06/05/2010,overcast- cool. Mild breeze. Water still murky w/ same reading. Single loon now.  Some calling + occasional 2nd loon.  Possibly too murky for good fishing. Cool temps persist and good soaking rain continues at least once/wk.
