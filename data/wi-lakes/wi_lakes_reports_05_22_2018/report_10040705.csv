09/20/2006,Hill Lake's normal depth is between 7 + 8 ft.  The lake is low at this time so the disk hit bottom at 6.75 ft.  Disk was in view to bottom.  Water had a very slight green tinge.
05/06/2007,As Hill Lake is only 7 to 8 feet in depth- that is the readson the Secchi reading is at 7 feet.  The disk was in plain view to the bottom- at 7 feet.  Very slight green tinge to the water.  Weather was cook + overcast.
05/30/2007,The depth of Hill Lake is only 7 to 8 feet.  The disk hit bottom at 7 feet and was in view to bottom.  Water had a green tinge to it.
06/20/2007,Hill Lake is only 7 to 8 ft. in depth.  This is the reason for the reading of 7 ft.  We hit bottom with the disk in view.  Water had a slight green tinge to it.
For the last two weeks Hill Lake was troubled by a very heavy Algae Bloom.  Since the rain storms this last week-end the Algae has cleared up substantially. Hill Lake only has a depth of 7 to 8 ft.  Disk hit bottom at 7 ft. and was still in view.  It was not the clarity of the water that caused the reading.  Water had a slight green tinge to it.
For the last two weeks Hill Lake  had a problem with a heavy Algae Bloom.  Since the rain storms over the week-end- the Algae is mainly gone on the surface.
08/17/2007,Lake is very low.  Water is clear with a slight tinge of green.  Disk in sight to bottom- at 5 feet.  Lake is 2 to 3 feet low.
09/26/2007,Weather was partly cloudy.  Disk in view to bottom- at 7 ft.  Slight green tinge to water.  Dwight Pugh also participates.
06/01/2008,Weather was clear + sunny.  Lake appeared very nice.
