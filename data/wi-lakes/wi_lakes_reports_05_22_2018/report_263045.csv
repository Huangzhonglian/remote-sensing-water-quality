Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
08/26/1993,Shoreline surface clean for this time of year.    
09/10/1993,Some wind effect frequent showers yesterday.    
06/08/1994,Tree pollen light to heavy with only light breeze- very warm + humid.    
07/04/1994,Light overcast.  After several hours of rain + heaviest boat traffic of the year was very surprised on depths.  Readings reported to great American secchi dip-in.    
07/24/1994,No lake activity all day!  mild wind- cool temp.- rain night before.  Some algae bloom near shore.    
08/22/1994,Second day after 3 days of heavy rain and storms.  No boat activity- wind is light.    
09/18/1994,Fantastic fall day- summer like temperature with light west breeze.  No one on the lake.  Heavy rains of 3-4 days ago left the lake level like early June.    
06/09/1995,Public perception due to pollen.  Reading taken after overnight moderate rain.  No boat traffic over past several days.    
06/15/1995,Light winds- light wave action.    
08/01/1995,Calm day- 2nd after 36 hours of heavy winds with wave action- leaves + needles on surface water good.    
08/15/1995,Windy with strong wave action- algae increasing daily- little rain past several days.    
06/25/1996,Lake vegetation growth seems late + slow this year. question if late (ice out) May have impact.    
07/05/1996,Vegetation growth continues to be slow. question if record + late heavy snows has increased the volume of runoff causing impact water (darker). reported information. to great "96" secchi dip.    
08/02/1996,Vegetation growth below normal for same period of past few years. visible algae-little on surface- wind calm.    
09/03/1996,Light wind-readings consistent with previous reports. question remains. why  history shows they are lower than past years. what effect does record snows + late ice out have     
06/21/1997,Some wave action.    
07/06/1997,Overcast- surface winds/wave action.    
07/28/1997,Surface water exceptional    
08/12/1997,No rain past 10 days- overcast- little trace of algae- surface winds/ wave action.    
09/14/1997,No traffic for 3 days.  Surface is placid.  Special note - latest date recorded- what effect does the sun have      
06/13/1998,Partly cloudy moderate wind    
07/04/1998,Heavy boat traffic typical for week of July 4.    
08/03/1998,Calm driest July in 109 years!    
08/31/1998,Lowest level in 20 yrs.  Warm fall breeze no rain in 3 wks.    
09/23/1998,Continued dry.  Partly sunny moderate winds + waves.    
10/06/1999,Water 50 F.    
06/29/2000,Partly cloudy- heavy rains 5 days prior.  No rain in 24 hours.  No traffic- light south wind.    
07/06/2000,Light north wind.  Reading during break in clouds.  No traffic after serious boat accident on the 4th.    
08/25/2000,Last days of summer. Safety and courtesy lacking with some boaters.    
10/06/2000,Lake placid- with change in sky coming out of the Northeast.    
07/05/2001,Light boat traffic for season.  Light wave action.    
08/01/2001,DNR moving and locating new fish cribs 2 days. Built in February.    
06/14/2002,Clear- cloudless sky. Light south wind- no activity.    
10/18/2002,Sunny- mild west breeze. Rippling water. Single boat. Preceding 3 days had strong winds and sporadic heavy rains. Science teacher friend came along: Air temp - 27 C- water temp - 21.5 C- D.O. - 8.3- conductivity - 75- site depth - 15 ft.    
06/11/2003,Neighbors took reading unassisted. Partly cloudy.    
06/30/2003,Some clouds- smooth water.    
07/29/2003,Light cooling breeze. 1 boat observed. 3 loons. No rain for 10 days.    
08/30/2003,Major growth of plant like- becoming dense this year. Observed 3 boats. Water temp 78 F. Took readings with assistance from neighbor.
