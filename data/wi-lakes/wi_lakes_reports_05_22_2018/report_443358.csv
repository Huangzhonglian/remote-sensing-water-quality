Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
08/31/2008,sunny- calm- air temp = 85 degrees- Secchi disk JUST barely visible on bottom (i.e.- at 9.0 feet)
07/08/2009,sunny- calm- Secchi disk easily seen on lake bottom- water level continues to be low
08/18/2009,sunny- very windy- Secchi disk easily seen on bottom- water level still dropping (-6" on my gauge)
05/15/2010,Lake level still low (-7" on my gauge).  Secchi disk EASILY seen on bottom; water is very clear.  Two loons seen on lake- arguing with pair of Canada geese possibly for nesting rights. Spring 2010 ice out at Emden Lake was on March 25- 2010.
05/29/2010,Water is exceedingly clear; Secchi disk EASILY seen on bottom.  Sunny and calm conditions.  Lake level still dropping- at -9" on my gauge.
07/10/2010,Sunny- breezy- small waves.  Water level is up 15 inches compared to late May- due to frequent heavy rains.  Level is at +6" on my gauge.  Water is not as clear as late May- though SD depth remains similar at 9.0 feet- the disk was not able to be seen on the bottom (total water depth at site of 10.25 feet).  No resident waterfowl seen on lake- though there were a couple visiting Mallards and one visiting loon.  QA/QC sample and duplicate phos. sample collected.  200 ml for Chla.
07/06/2011,sunny- calm- water very high (10 inches below top of stage gauge pipe)- high levels of tannin color in the lake- iris versicolor just stopping bloom period
08/03/2011,sunny- slight breeze- water levels still high with tannin color- 3 inches of rain in the past 2 days- water level is 10-5/8 inches below top of stage gauge pipe
08/20/2011,sunny- calm- water level 13.5 inches below top of stage gauge pipe
09/24/2011,sunny- calm- water less tannin color than earlier in the year- water level is 18-1/4 inches below top of stage gauge pipe
07/07/2012,sunny- light breezes- hot temps (90s) for the past week.  2 inches of rainfall the previous night- total water depth was 10.0 feet
08/26/2012,cloudy- light breeze- 80s daytime highs for the past week- total depth of 9.0 feet- Secchi disk EASILY seen on bottom- lake level 3 to 4 inches lower than early July sampling.
08/10/2014,Sunny- calm- no rain in past 6 days.  Water level still "high" but down a few inches from washing against the Iris versicolor located by the pier.  Phosphorus and chlorophyll collected today- as well as DO/temp profile.  DO/temp profile taken with personally-owned meter.
04/26/2015,sunny- slight breeze- water temp 47 degrees F- ice out on April 7- 2015
07/03/2015,cloudy- winds 10 mph- DO/temp profile taken with my HACH meter
08/16/2015,hazy- winds 15 mph- DO/temp profile taken with my Hach meter- lake level down 3-5 inches since July 3
07/09/2016,sunny- calm- DO/temp profile taken with my Hach meter
07/31/2016,sunny- calm- water level still very high
08/07/2016,sunny- calm- water level still VERY high
04/09/2017,overcast- calm- water temp near shore was 45 degrees.  Ice off began on April 7 and was all gone on April 8- 2017.  Water level is extremely high (several inches OVER top of pipe by the south pier).
07/09/2017,sunny- calm- lake level still very high.
08/12/2017,sunny- calm- lake level slowly starting to come down a little (currently about 2 inches below top of pipe by south pier).  DO/temp profile taken using YSI meter.
09/04/2017,partly cloudy- windy- lake level continues to retreat very slowly (estimated to be 4 inches below top of pipe by south pier).  DO/temp profile taken using YSI meter.
