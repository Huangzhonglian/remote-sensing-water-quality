I talked to a neighbor who was fishing while I was taking the secchi reading. We discussed the late sucker spawning. He said the crappies are just now heading to the beds- and the beds are in different areas of the lake this year due to the lower lake depth. 

The lake experienced a cisco die-off the past 1.5 weeks. Apparently the oxygen on the north end of the lake dipped enough to cause the die-off. The Bayfield County fish biologist was consulted- and he said a spring die-off is not unusual especially in a deep ice year. 

The dead fish drew in many eagles- including one golden eagle. The eagles chased the 3 loons off the lake.  And so it goes!  As my fisherman friend and I were talking - we saw a coyote poking along the west shore of the lake - presumably after dead fish.
