06/27/2013,The lake is covered with yellow green pine tree dust making readings difficult. This seems to be the heaviest coveringt at this time of year that I can recall.
07/01/2013,Partly Cloudy w/moderate chop
Lots of weed growth in the last week- warmer weather
07/11/2013,clear and calm.....perfect conditions to measure. 
07/15/2013,Partly cloudy with a slight ripple on the surface of the water. Thermocline estimated at 20 feet using a clinefinder.
07/29/2013,Perfect day after many days of wind and several days of very cold weather. Surface temperature 68.2?F- down 10? in one week.
08/11/2013,Very clear- 50% clouds- I took two readings to verify the clear condition
08/15/2013,Took temp with Cline-finder........thermocline at 26 ft.
08/17/2013,Slight chop caused some drift.....too deep to anchor.
08/28/2013,Nice conditions. 2 inches of rain 48 hours prior.
07/23/2014,Perfect Conditions
