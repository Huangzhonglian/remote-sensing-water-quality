09/14/2014,Cool- sunny day; light winds
06/30/2015,Cloudy with variable winds
08/18/2015,Cloudy and light chop on lake
07/31/2016,Bright sunny day- calm winds
07/25/2017,Partly cloudy- light winds- mild temps.  Water levels are significantly higher this year.  Speculation that shoreline debris collected over the years of low water levels has contributed to the lower DO at depth.
08/07/2017,Past few days have been cloudy likely contributor to the deeper secchi readings due to less algae bloom.  Substantial rain has raised lake level considerably (over two feet vertically) and introduced much debris into the water that before was on dry land. This may be contributing to lower DO reading as compared to previous years.
09/10/2017,Clear- cool- windy day.  Lake up about one foot vertically since last reading.  Water clear but distinctively tea colored.  DO at shallower levels seem to have recovered to normal.  Virtually no DO at 20 feet deep or deeper.  Water temps cooler than expected for this time of year as cloudy and cool air temps precede.
