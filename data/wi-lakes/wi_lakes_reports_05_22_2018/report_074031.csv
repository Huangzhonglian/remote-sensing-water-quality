05/04/2008,partly cloudy- occasional wind gusts- secchi reading at 8 ft. averaged over 3 tries. hit bottom- lake level is normal- color is clear slightly yellow
07/13/2008,We had a bad storm the night of 7/11 which may have affected the murkiness of the water below the surface.

05/29/2011,overcast- no wind- had a partner to double check the reading since there is a 2 ft. difference from last fall.  Could be due to the high water level and presence of more rust color due to tamarack runoff in ditches into lake  Spotted an otter.

lake remains a rusty brown color possibly due to elevated water levels bringing in runoff from the decayed tamarack trees in ditches leading to the lake
