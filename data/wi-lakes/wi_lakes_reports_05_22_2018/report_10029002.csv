Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
06/14/2014,Wavy but not white caps.  Very blue skies and no boat traffic.  For Lake Wis- the water seemed very clean.  My husband- Ron Smith- drove our pontoon and helped find the GPS coordinates and the visual markers for next time
06/22/2014,light waves and light weekend boat traffic.  This was after a week of heavy rain and wind
07/04/2014,Very calm with no boat traffic.  Very weedy in shallow areas.  This was my first test from the kayak and I was not able to anchor but there was no wind and no waves..
07/11/2014,slight breeze with slight waves.  Can't anchor my kayak
07/17/2014,Calm.  Silver dollar size algae chunks floating
07/27/2014,Windy and rough.  Heavy algae
08/02/2014,Small waves.  The water is getting more algae by the day.  Worth noting that I am pretty squeamish when it comes to algae so while many people are in the water- apparently enjoying it- I don't even like to kayak next to it. Small waves.  Water is getting dirtier by the day
08/06/2014,I did not do the testing because the water was filled with blue green algae and smelled horrible.  In 11 years of living on the lake I have never seen it like this.  I would not even put my kayak in

06/02/2015,weedy with lots of milfoil closer to shore.  very wavy day.
06/24/2015,Lots of carp near shore.  Large clumps of algae and lots of milfoil near shore.   The testing hole has lots of dispersed algae.  Slightly breezy day.
