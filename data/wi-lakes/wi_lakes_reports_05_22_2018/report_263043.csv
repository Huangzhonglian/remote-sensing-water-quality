Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
06/29/2016,partly cloudy- a little breezy- nice day
07/24/2016,partly cloudy now- rain last night- 
08/08/2016,very small algae bloom yesterday (8/7). Today water is clear and warm. Partly cloudy.
08/21/2016,The temperature and dissolved oxygen reading were extremely different today than anything I have taken before. As you can see- for all readings it's about the same temp and oxygen level. Readings were taken several times- I came up with the same results. I asked Zach Wilson to check the meter (which he did that same day) and he said it was working fine- I might have caught the lake during turn over. Also note: the blue D.O. meter I use has a max depth of 16 feet. The brown meter used on the Flowage can go much deeper (my separate temp gauge can go deeper). I note this just in case anyone is wondering why April's results include an 18 foot temp/d.o.. Zach and Heather did that one using the brown meter.
