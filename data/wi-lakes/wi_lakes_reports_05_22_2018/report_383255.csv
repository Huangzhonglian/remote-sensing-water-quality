06/21/2012,Mederate NW wind- partly cloudy- observing dense watershield cover around lake perimeter.
07/07/2012,Moderate NE breeze- partly cloudy- widely scattered globs of algae observed- 90 degree plus temperatures for the previous several days.
07/19/2012,Gentle breeze- clear- globs of algae are now larger and more numereous than last observation. The previous several days were cloudy and/or hot and did not allow for monitoring on schedule with satellite.
07/24/2012,Gentle NE breeze- partly cloudy- globs of algae somewhat diminished but still present. Large chunks (several feet across and thick) of bottom material (silt- weeds- roots- etc.) have floated to surface about 50-100 feet from shore around perimeter of lake. Weeds- both floating and submerged- are much more abundant than in previous years.
05/31/2013,Moderate west wind- partly cloudy.
07/11/2013,Moderate E Breeze- Partly Cloudy. Two very large families of geese and several families of ducks present for the summer.
07/20/2013,Wind light and variable- Partly cloudy- Soft globs of algae (about two feet across) widely scattered around lake- Previous week was very hot (low 90's).
07/25/2013,Moderate NW wind- Partly cloudy.
08/08/2013,Calm- partly cloudy.
08/23/2013,Moderate W breeze- Partly cloudy- Observed globs of algae scattered on surface.
09/03/2013,Light N breeze- Clear- All families of geese are gone- Several families of ducks remain- Large particles of bottom material (roots and silt) floating to the surface in 2-4 feet of water in many places.
09/16/2013,Light NE breeze- clear.
09/27/2013,Light S wind- partly cloudy.
05/30/2014,Light S breeze- clear sky- the water was the clearest ever recorded- did not observe any fish beds as were observed in previous years -probably froze out the last 3 winters.
06/08/2014,Moderate NE wind- clear sky.
06/22/2014,Calm wind- filtered sunshine.
07/04/2014,Calm wind- partly cloudy.

07/24/2014,Light W breeze- partly cloudy.
07/30/2014,Light NW wind- partly cloudy- observed very widely scattered globs of algae.
08/05/2014,Light E wind- partly cloudy- globs of algae slightly more numerous and slightly larger than noted at last observation. Watershield and water lilies extend about 200 feet from shore around complete lake perimeter. Did not notice any invasives.
08/15/2014,Calm wind- clear- slightly more algae since last sampling.
08/24/2014,Moderate S wind- partly cloudy- less algae globs.
09/09/2014,Very light SW breeze- mostly sunny.
09/23/2014,Calm- clear.

06/01/2015,Light and variable gusty wind- clear.
06/06/2015,Light S wind- partly cloudy.
06/14/2015,Filtered sunshine- calm.
06/26/2015,Calm- partly sunny with filtered sunshine. Having trouble getting on schedule with satellite this year because of wind and clouds.
07/02/2015,Clear- calm
07/08/2015,Light S breeze- Filtered sunshine.
07/15/2015,Light NE breeze- clear. Observing many submerged weeds not seen before. Suspect weeds to be Eurasian Water-Milfoil and another that is much less abundant. Will attempt better ID in the next few weeks.
07/26/2015,Light W breeze- partly cloudy.
08/05/2015,Calm- partly cloudy. Observing widely scattered small globs of algae. Noticed that geese are not as abundant as in past years- probably due to higher water level and more and higher shoreline weeds.
08/15/2015,Clear- calm- hot.
08/26/2015,Partly sunny- calm.
