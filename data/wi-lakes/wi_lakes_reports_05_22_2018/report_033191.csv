Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
07/15/2014,Jim Peterson and neighbor Jerry Woods did the test for the first time on Lake Montanis. Clear day in the middle 70's.  As far as we know there is not a depth of 14 ' but 10' plus.  The lake is in need of testing with the algae blueish-green and many more weeds in the last 3 years around my property on the north side of the lake as well as others.
07/27/2017,Blue sky about 80 degrees Blue sky about 80 degrees
08/30/2017,In the past week we received 4 inches of rain
