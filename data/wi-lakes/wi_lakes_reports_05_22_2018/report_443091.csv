Lakefront homeowners asked what they thought of the condition of the lake compared to past years-"water seemed clearer and less silty-less brown 'fuzz' on the kids when they get out"- "really cold about 8" off the surface"- "awesome". Kayaked out to deepest part of the lake-dragonflies- muskrat kept me company.
