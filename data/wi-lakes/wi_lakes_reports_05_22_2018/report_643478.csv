Water at the highest level that it has been for quite a few years.

They actually waited until we were at the dock and then swam off only to return later on.

Apparently they were either non-viable or else the loon just left them when the water got too high and the weather turned cold.  This is so sad as this is the first year in six that the eggs were not taken by a predator.
09/08/2015,Nice day.  No signs of any wildlife except for a mink swimming by a pier.  Haven't seen the families of Mallards in quite some time and have not heard or seen the loons lately.
