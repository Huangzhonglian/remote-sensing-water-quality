07/20/2001,DEEP SPOT- BASELINE LAKE SAMPLING    
06/05/2015,Overcast sky and some wave action
07/31/2015,Very windy- but clear and hot
08/26/2015,Wind finally dieted down enough to take a decent reading.  The sun came out too.
09/09/2015,Finally another calm and sunny day to take a reading.  Lake was churned up badly over the Labor Day weekend.  Many more boats than usual pulling tubes and skiers.  Just what the lake was intended for.
09/25/2015,Beautiful day
10/10/2015,A bit of a wind today with choppy water
11/04/2015,Thin overcast- not a bright day- light wind out of the southwest- moderate wave action
04/17/2016,Beautiful sunny day with just a little wave action.
05/08/2016,Nice day- a little choppy on the lake but not too bad
06/10/2016,Still windy and overcast
06/22/2016,Windy
08/03/2016,Finally a sunny day without a lot of wind or wave action.  Water has tiny white spots floating in the water... think it is some of the seaweed releasing seed pods.
04/28/2017,Very thin overcast at high altitude- light wind out of the ENE at 6 mph
06/09/2017,Great for taking a reading- clear sky and very light breeze
08/29/2017,Beautiful sunny day with a very light wind- water temp at the surface 74 F
