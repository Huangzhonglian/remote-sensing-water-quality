` Some Spirogyra conjugating. 
06/17/2013,Finally excellent monitoring conditions with sun- a few white clouds and wind ca. 5 mph. Also motor boat fixed helped! North shore pier showed beds of Eurasian milfoil coming near surface in clear lake. Usually macrophytes diverse there.
Floating mats of cut-off macrophytes included: Lemna spp.- attached filamentous algae (Spirogyra- (conjugation observed) Zygnema- Rhizoclonium + Cladophora) + abundant cottonwood seeds often colored some contents of mats white. Floating Lemna spp evident at East end surface.

Some flowers/seeds found on few broken off exotic Eurasian milfoil plants- as well as natives Ranunculus (white flowers of Buttercup) and Potamogeton pectinatus (looking like small beads on a string for Sago Pondweed). White water lilies blooming in Mill Pond on very abundant plants.
Variety of visible blue-green algae particles scattered down several inches below lake surface ? especially in East. Not a ?bloom?.
Some torn-out-by-boats floating mats of macrophytes- seed filaments- insects- and filamentous algae- etc. Terrestrial trees are fruiting.
07/11/2013,Sunny- dead- flat calm and any wind light and variable. Macrophytes growing toward and on surface with filamentous algae attached. Motorboat slop. Variety of visible blue-green algae scattered down several inches below lake surface ? especially in East - and along shore. Not a ?bloom?.
Floating mats of macrophytes- seed filaments- insects- and green filamentous algae includes Zygnema- Spirogyra- Mougeotia. Attached to many submersed aquatic plants are large clumps + webs of green filamentous alga sp. Rhizoclonium as well as small quantities of the above green algae.
07/20/2013,Sunny with clouds and calm with very light variable wind. Activity of boats of all varieties and motorboat slop was especially bad! Macrophytes growing thickly toward and floating on surface with attached filamentous algae (Zygnema- Mougeotia- Spirogyra). Many more gulls appearing- several hatches of insects- grasshoppers- fireflies and damsel- and dragonflies. Very few butterflies noted.
Variety of visible blue-green algae- etc. scattered down several inches below lake surface ? especially in East.
Not a ?bloom?.
Yesterday - due to wind and waves - the lake was very dirty - apparently with suspended sediments - and many aquatic plants floating and attached near pier impeded swimming enjoyment.
07/31/2013,Sunny- hazy- partly cloudy with light SW wind ca. 4 mph. Surface has foam- molted gull feathers- floating clumps of macrophytes ?sometimes looking a little like the ?Sargasso Sea? - along the shore out about pier length and between neighborhood piers definitely impeding swimmers. Blue-greens near surface are Anabaena- Microcystis and Gleotrichia- especially the latter- showing in the East end. This variety of visible plankton- some also listed below- are scattered on and down several inches below lake surface.
Macrophytes growing thickly toward surface between and far out from piers are covered with very large quantities of attached filamentous algae. These are Zygnema- Mougeotia- Spirogyra + especially Rhizoclonium. Alga forming a fringe along rocks at lake waterline is Cladophora.
Vallisneria is appearing among other macrophytes on the bottom of the lake in the littoral zone. With boating activity- this native plant - with its small roots and long leaves and flower stalks- - is very easily pulled out- floats and becomes very messy. Their floating masses have been observed decaying on lake surface on hot- sunny days other years.
08/03/2013,Sunny and calm at start. Wind changed from East to North increasing at East end to about 5 mph. Not very good sailing that weekend for sailing regatta.
Blue-greens near surface and below surface ? like ?tapioca? - but not a bloom.
No plankton tow and no Custer Colors.
08/08/2013,Sunny and calm with very light variable winds. Surface has foam- molted gull feathers- floating clumps of macrophytes ?sometimes looking a little like the ?Sargasso Sea? - along the shore out about pier length and between neighborhood piers definitely impeding swimmers. Blue-greens near surface are Anabaena- Microcystis and Gleotrichia- especially the latter- showing in the East end and a faint scum Anabaena. Otherwise the variety of visible plankton- some also listed below- are scattered on and down several inches below lake surface.
Macrophytes growing thickly toward surface between and far out from piers are covered with very large quantities of attached filamentous algae. These are Zygnema- Mougeotia- Spirogyra + especially Rhizoclonium. Alga forming a fringe along rocks at lake waterline is Cladophora.
Vallisneria leaves are nearing surface but so far no signs of flowers on their spiral ?stalks? or the floating ?boats? carrying pollen formed underwater among the roots of the native plant known as Wild Celery.
08/14/2013,Sunny with dead- flat calm today. Many- many gulls have arrived. Surface has foam- molted gull feathers- floating clumps of macrophytes. Saw wonderful large school of minnows near surface at east deep-water station. Noticed 3 carp and 3 pan fish at pier. Wild celery leaves (Vallisneria) appearing very often in littoral zone all over lake. Macrophytes are growing thickly toward littoral zone surface between and far out from piers and are covered with very large quantities of attached filamentous algae: Zygnema- Mougeotia- Spirogyra + especially Rhizoclonium. Duck weed and skim of Anabaena floating at surface at west station today - probably because so calm.
Recently the harvester came to my pier while I was on the pier and I watched it go around the pier area as DNR recommends. After the harvester left- the weeds were still thick- tall and covered with same thick algae. The mess of thick plants and algae seemed to rise up again and were not improved by the presence of the harvester. (Photo taken) The harvester should have accumulated a large- heavy load of aquatic plants just at my pier with the quantity of them we have this summer. The harvester visit was very disappointing. Perhaps heavy algal quantity is causing problems with unsuccessful cutting through aquatic plants? (macrophytes?) stems.
Will a new harvester be able to cut deeper? And unload onto the transport barge when cutting very large quantities of weeds? Problems persist and abound for the use of this lake for those who live here and wish to use it for their enjoyment. Boat navigation in some places on lake is difficult due to weeds- too- resulting in motor problems.
08/17/2013,Sunny and hot out here on the lake! Calm but terrible motor-boat-slop as a Saturday!
Wonderful minnows visible in deep water near surface at east end and also out away from north shore pier. Fishermen are reporting minnows all over the lake and seeking official identification. Unofficially may be shiners of some sort.
Many years ago- emerald green shiners were present around piers throughout lake; one could net bait for fishing easily off piers. One year they all died out possibly due to some chemical impacting the lake water.
Noticed masses of bright green filamentous algae with some bubbles of oxygen covering macrophytes along north shore and these masses are very easily dispersed- i.e.- are past their prime. The main algal species noticed are Mougeotia (some conjugation observed)- Rhizoclonium- Spirogyra and Ulothrix.
Aquatic plants now showing their tops with fruits through the algae are many Long-leaf pondweed (Potamogeton nodosus) and a few Clasping?leaf pondweed (Potamogeton richardsonii). Wild celery (Vallisneria americana) is also abundant. Eurasian milfoil seemed underneath the algal masses in these locations along north shore.
I observed one monarch butterfly flying over the lake surface heading south west and was pleased to hear of a friend who saw more than 30 over several days of driving in this area and toward Fox Lake.
08/31/2013,Today is partly cloudy- with low + variable winds. Terrible motor-boat-slop as a Saturday!
The East Secchi is very unusual and I may have been in an area that was stirred up for some reason. I should have moved and tried it again.
Unknown minnows in a large school visible again near surface in deep-water. Large masses of floating aquatic plants! One monarch butterfly is seen flying over lake.
Today it is strange that so very few Daphnia + Cyclops are evident in the two samples of plankton tows at both East and West as these critters are usually very visible in samples via eyes. A fishing guide believes these two listed above show up on his depth finder at 30 feet and the bluegills are at a level below them. I would like to go deeper with the plankton net for a more satisfying ?picture?. I wonder if this observation will happen again.
10/02/2013,Sky is sunny with no clouds and lake is dead-flat calm. Many of the floating weeds are in mats and some mats are looking brown as though plants are decaying. Wild celery floating in Dartford Bay along the shore often has bubbles around their masses and I do not know exactly what it means but possibly more decaying.
Many molted gull feathers floating on surface from the many gulls. West end had many small insects flying just over surface and dead ones forming a scum on the lake while East end had no insects evident at this time. Faint Anabaena scum (as so calm) and many plankton + blue-greens forming ?Tapioca? appearance several inches below surface at both ends.
Three flocks of coots are on lake and a larger flock is in Dartford Bay.
Mimic shiners spotted at East end today.
The filamentous algae are gone. Perhaps the windy days have helped this happen. What has happened to them? From my slowly moving boat- the shallow water of the littoral zone is very clear on this calm day revealing sandy and stony areas among the aquatic plants. This clear view of the bottom has not been visible for weeks because of the thick filamentous algae covering the massive macrophytes during this season earlier.
Now Eurasian milfoil has mainly empty stems with a few leaves near their tops just below the surface.
Many small-sized shells of dead zebra mussels are visible lying on the bottom as well as live ones attached to hard surfaces and to some aquatic plants.

09/24/2014,day was very cloudy with variable wind at ca. 5- 8 MPH
09/25/2014,25 was dead-flat calm and sunny- perfect for all the other monitoring: the plankton tow- Secchi + temperatures. Many gulls and many floating molted feathers on surface as well as pulled-out aquatic plants (espec. Vallisneria) and algae blooms with East end worse =  (?tapioca?= larger colonies visible in the lake water). Perhaps the lack of waves and wind did not mix?up the algae bloom to make it less noticeable.
Flying monarch butterflies evident as well as coots- other ducks- cranes + geese with turkeys + many deer in area

Surface of lake is very scummy with previous floating-through-the air seeds- tree droppings and many tiny insects.  No weeds are visible in the lake at this time but occasional deep clumps of filamentous algae in shallow areas. Note the weed harvester is located behind island at Hattie Sherwood Park now.
Not a bird seen out on lake today but 3 cormorants were observed last time out.

06/01/2017,Surface of lake is very murky and scummy with seeds- tree droppings + many tiny insects. East end has unusual watery brown Custer Color that I

 	Today?s wind changed from very light to actually dead-flat-calm at west end- but later at the east end was about 5 mph from the SW. The sky had many interesting clouds and some blue sky - so partly cloudy. 
Surface of lake in some places showed cottonwood seeds and foam. The ?tapioca look? of many particles distributed through several inches down from the surface at east end as blue-greens appear - plus pollen- pieces of leaves. duckweed- etc.  White water lily is in bloom in Mill Pond.
Very dirty water in lake due to Monday?s storm run-off and lots of tree damage.  By Wednesday- today- lake was much clearer than previously!  Not so much filamentous algae present as seen earlier.
The tops of a few scattered weeds are visible in the lake now that clearer water present. 
Zebra mussels are not especially obvious on bottom rocks or ladders in shallow areas. 
Very tiny- new minnows are in a school at a north side pier in shallow water; also present are blue-gills- carp + bass. New ducklings in Dartford Bay area and many other birds ? parents and juveniles - abound in our yards- woods and along waterfronts.  
I heard that - many minnows present during 2016-17 winter?s fishing all - over the lake.

07/01/2017,	Today?s wind changed from light SW- to about 8 mph  SW. The sky had many interesting clouds and some blue sky - so partly cloudy.  Motorboat slop was as expected on the lake near the 4th.
Surface of lake in some places showed cottonwood seeds and foam. MANY  particles (blue-green algae) distributed through several inches down from the surface - especially at east end.
Near piers tops of a few scattered weeds are visible in the lake now that clearer water present.  Some have filamentous algae on their tops. Thick beds of weeds are almost to the surface out in deeper water. 
A few gulls are present and a family of geese seen at Sugar Loaf.
 
07/17/2017,The sky is partly cloudy- the wind very light (SE) + terrible blue-green scum by afternoon! Dead-flat calm does help the bloom situation!
	Floating are patches of filamentous green algae (Spirogyra + Zygnema) mixed with broken-off weeds.	Weeds covered with filamentous algae are becoming evident at ladder of pier + VERY evident when moving boat over deeper water. Gulls are more abundant + a first molted feathers seen from them.

08/01/2017,	Sunny and SW wind ca. 8 mph with high cirrus and a few other clouds at the horizon.  It is a very lovely summer day with little boating activity. 
	The lake water is very clear near my pier along the shore and I could see the carp with an orange pectoral fin and head ? much larger now than previous years when it has appeared in my area.
The wind today and over the last few days may have distributed the blue-greens to other depths (see Turbidity on page 2).  Previously (at bottom of Report #10 and 2 days after monitoring) when the east wind had piled up the blue-greens so pea soup developed and the bottom/fish- etc- were unseen! I was shocked!

08/07/2017,Today is sunny with few clouds and NE wind ca. 7 mph. 
	The lake water is very clear near my pier along the north shore with no fish visible while on the pier at various times today. Many particles (mainly blue-greens) hovering in the upper surface of the water column throughout the lake. Each 17 ft. vertical plankton net sample is VERY GREEN and full of zoo- and phyto-plankton! MANY OF THE BLUE-GREENS ARE TOXIC TO DOGS- HUMANS AND OTHER ANIMALS?
	Checking the cove at Sugar Loaf I found many tiny white female flowers of Vallisneria (wild-celery) blooming above lake and below are their very abundant leaves. A few mature clumps of Potamogeton pectinatus (Sago Pondweed) are also visible near surface and Eurasian milfoil- of course.
	At my north shore pier- besides the above weeds- are several large clumps of Heteranthia dubia (water-stargrass) and lots of Eurasian milfoil. All are often supporting filamentous algae containing mainly Spirogyra + some Mougeotia. Cladophora grows on the rocks along the shore.  Gulls are more abundant now adding nutrients to the lake by their many molted feathers and their excrements. Foam is often on the water.
08/15/2017,Today is sunny with clouds and light NE wind which diminished to nothing and increased again.
	The lake water is quite clear near my pier along the north shore with only very small black minnows visible. Many particles (mainly blue-greens) are hovering in the upper surface of the water column throughout the lake. Each 17 ft. vertical plankton net sample is VERY GREEN and full of zoo- and phyto-plankton!  
Gulls are more abundant (counted ca. 70 on canopy- end of pier and float at a neighbor?s waterfront one day) adding nutrients to the lake by their many molted feathers and their excrements. 
Foam is often on the water with torn-out weeds. Weeds + filamentous algae are getting close to the surface at many piers.

09/13/2017,Today is sunny with no clouds and mainly dead-flat calm. 
	The lake water is quite clear near my pier along the north shore with very small black minnows anad shiners visible. Many particles (mainly blue-greens) are hovering in the upper surface of the water column throughout the lake. Each 17 ft. vertical plankton net sample is not either as green and or as full of zoo- and phytoplankton as seen previously this season!  
Gulls are very abundant adding nutrients to the lake by their many molted feathers and their excrements.  One merganser and many ducks noticed; some coots are present now.
Foam is often on the water with torn-out weeds ? especially wild celery leaves. Fruits are now forming on some masses of wild celery; now would be a good time for a harvester to move in and control some of this nuisance plant?s population by removing their obvious turions!

09/23/2017,Today is sunny with no clouds and mainly dead-flat calm. 
	The lake water is quite clear near my pier along the north shore + no fish observed. Many particles (mainly blue-greens) are hovering in the upper surface of the water column throughout the lake
	Floating weeds are mainly wild celery with foam usually present; fruits observed on many.
Both 17 ft. vertical plankton net samples are again not as green or as full of zoo- and phytoplankton as earlier this summer.  
Gulls are very abundant adding nutrients to the lake by their many molted feathers and their excrements.  Three merganser and many local ducks (mallards) noticed; some coots are present now.

10/16/2017,	Sunny and SW wind ca. 8 mph with no clouds visible and little boating activity. The wind velocity increased by at the east end of lake. 
	The lake water is very clear near my pier along the shore and I could see no fish. Lots of foam on the lake- often in streaks and wind has piled small clumps on the shore. Also foam is very pronounced around masses of floating weeds. Observed many gulls on lake and also large masses of coots now gathering along lake?s shores and Dartford Bay.  
	Duckweed is floating on surface in several large masses at eastern part of lake probably moving back to their main source- Silver Creek estuary after several days of northeast winds. Perhaps because of the increased wind at east end and the duckweed- the lake appeared murky there.
