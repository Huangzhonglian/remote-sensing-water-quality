07/27/2007,Large lake section (east basin) only:  sunny day- moderate breeze- rippled/wavey water;  garage construction; five boats and 1 jet ski- floating weeds.  Interesting note:  While in the west basin- we noticed the beginning of a distant (forest) fire in a northeastly direction.  (We later found out it was near Lily Lake.)  Within 10 minutes (and going from the west basin to the east basin) we could see the fire spread and had cast a smoky haze over Fish Lake.

08/25/2007,East basin (large lake) only:  Mostly Cloudy- light breeze- ripply water; 5 boats and 1 jet ski on lake; construction of one cabin on north side of lake.

SPECIAL NOTATION:  Attempted to take lake level measurments.  However- found that because of low level of lake and deeper freezing- ice caused the base fitting tool in lake to bend at an angle.  In an attempt to straighten and take measurement- the measuring rod broke.  Therefore- we were unable to measure the lake.  We will need to obtain new lake level equipment and have it installed- if possible.  
06/15/2008,East Basin:  Partly cloudly; slight breeze- water had slight ripple; 2 boats on lake; 2 cabins under construction; 2 loons on lake

IMPORTANT NOTE:  Bill installed a new water level staff gauge in lake in front of our cabin (2665 Pine Knoll Rd. on north side of lake).  The previous staff gauge broke over the winter and was located at (29089 Brozie Rd. on south side of lake). Therefore- from here on- all future water level measurements will be taken from the 2965 Pine Knoll Rd. location.  Also- today's measurement will be the new baseline measurement for all future lake levels. 
08/24/2008,West Basin:  Sunny (with a few clouds)- slight ripple in water- no breeze; three boats on lake; saw one adult eagle.

NOTE:  We tried to take the water temperature and water samples- however- the wind picked up after taking the secchi reading and the water current became too strong to take it for the month of June.   Will do it at a later date.
07/11/2009,Sky clear- slight breeze; 2 boats on lake.
07/23/2009,Sunny with thin clouds- water very calm- some particulates in water; 2 boats on lake; saw a turtle under water and a loon.  NOTE:  We have not noticed any baby loons on either lake yet this year.
