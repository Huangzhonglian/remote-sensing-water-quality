Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
07/08/2004,DEEP HOLE - 6FT INTEGRATED SAMPLE    
10/08/2005,Lake levels too low to get boat in water in September.    
07/20/2006,Need Rain! Lake's getting so low it's getting near impossible to launch the boat.
08/03/2006,Over the last 10 days we've gotten 6" of needed rain. Need at least another 6-8" to bring lake levels up to where they should be.
08/15/2006,The 6" of rain we got earlier in the month has all but evaporated away. The boat is again resting on the lake bottom when next to the pier.
09/06/2006,Where is our rain It's all going south of us. We are down over 12" by now.
10/02/2006,Couldn't ask for a nicer fall day. Makes one glad he's retired and able to be outside to enjoy it.
08/01/2007,We need rain!!!!!!
05/19/2008,Almost got caught in a whirlwind that suddenly moved out from the shore and  into the lake. After heading directly toward us for a while it suddenly changed directions and moved away.

06/17/2008,What's with all this wind this year  Making it hard to do testing on a scheduled bases.
07/14/2008,Lake's getting as low as it was last year. May not be able to get boat in water to do any August tests if we don't get lots of rain.
08/19/2008,As low as our lake is again this year I probably wouldn't be able to get the boat off of shore to do any further lake monitoring. 
08/01/2016,Large areas of Watershield.
06/15/2017,Air temperature 77 degrees.  Sunny blue sky. Water levels historically high- with shoreline flooding. Water shield present. pH not done.
