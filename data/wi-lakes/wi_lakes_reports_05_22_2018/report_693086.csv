Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
06/01/2017,Great late Spring day- a lot of birds and animals on the move on and around the lake.  We were fortunate enough to observe a pair of loons- what a special treat.  I was assisted in the testing by my husband- Bob Wells. 
07/24/2017,Beautiful day- clear blue skies- temp. upper 70's.  Light wind- light boat traffic.
08/28/2017,Sunset Lake is in the same condition as the other lakes we monitor- it is so sad.  The Lake Association- and the DNR need to get in the same boat save our beautiful lake
