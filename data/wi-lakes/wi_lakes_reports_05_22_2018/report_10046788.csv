Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
08/06/2016,Sunny- low wind- 83 degrees
08/13/2016,Partly cloudy.  Winds about 10 mph. Macrophytes were interfering with an accurate Secchi Disc reading. We moved about 150 east of desired location to do the measurement. This is at the edge of the dense part of the plant growth. 
08/25/2016,Sunny day. Light winds.  Found open water just a short distance from sampling location
07/20/2017,Sunny and warm.  Lake water looks very green
07/27/2017,Sunny- lake is green- 10 mph winds so wavey
08/02/2017,Sunny- no wind
