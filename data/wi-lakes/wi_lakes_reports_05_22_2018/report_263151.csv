Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
04/28/2009,Put out loon nesting platform with vegetation.  
pH - 6
Marcoinvertebrates collected:
Caddisfly
scud
water mite
06/02/2009,No nesting activity- no sign of a loon.
Students focused on invasive species as it is Invasive Species Awareness Month.  Students also learned about shoreland buffers and took percentage of cover (Canopy- Shrub- Groundcover) for a 100 foot transect from shore - upland.
pH - 6
04/26/2010,Windy- sunny- snow has been gone for about a month.  Ice out April 1.  Early leaf out- trees are budding.  Macro Invertebrates collected include dragonfly nymph- scud- midge larva- caddisfly larva- water mite- crawling water beetles and alderfly larva.  
09/01/2010,Shoreland and aquatic plants collected included wild rice- spadderdock- wild bog cranberries- cotton grass- rattlesnake manna grass.  Removed nesting platform- no loons present- nested naturally 1st attempt- failed- nested on platform 2nd attempt- failed 2 eggs found in tact.  
05/04/2011,pH- 5.25
