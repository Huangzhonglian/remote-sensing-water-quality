06/28/2016,Van Dorn bottle sample collected at 50 feet depth for TP and Silica. 

Trout Lake Station Hach HQ30D SN/130300085407 temp and optical DO meter used for all profile measurements June-July-August 2016 in both Minocqua Lake and Kawaguesaga Lake Deep Holes by John R. Gray and Regis Brost.
07/18/2016,John R. Gray and Regis Brost from Gray fishing boat. 

Used Trout Lake Station HACH HQ30D S/N 130300085407 DO/Temp profiler

0-6' TP- ChlA- and silica samples; also TP sample from 50' depth- van dorn bottle. 

6 mph wind- bit choppy. 
07/19/2016,John R. Gray and Regis Brost in Gray fishing boat.

Used Trout Lake Station HACH HQ30D S/N 130300085407 DO/Temp profiler

Used Trout Lake Station HACH HQ30D S/N 130300085407 DO/Temp profiler

Choppy- wind 8 mph. Line vertical- no drift.  collected total P and silica samples from 0-6' and 50' depths

Used Trout Lake Station HACH HQ30D profiling DO and temp meter

John Gray and Regis Brost collected data 
08/15/2016,Used Trout Lake Station HACH HQ30D S/N 130300085407

Samples collected from John Gray's fishing boat by Regis Brost and John Gray. 

Noticed five belly-up ~16" cisco between Country Club and Jossart Island. Later reports of "a hundred" dead cisco in this region. None noticed in Lake Kawaguesaga an hour later. 

Collected 0-6 feet TP- ChlA- orthophosphate- and silica samples. 

Also using Van Dorn smapler- obtained samples for TP at 15'- 27'- 35'- 43'- 51'- with orthophosphate sample also at 43' . No flocculants/sediments observed in any Van Dorn bottle sample (see July data- deep samples found to have ~neutrally buoyant particles). 
09/19/2016,Used borrowed Trout Lake Station HACH HQ30D DO/Temp meter SN 130300085407

Worked alone in moderately windy conditions.

Secchi disk reading at 0924 9/19/16 by Sandy Wickman and John R. Gray- choppy water/overcast- 12.5 feet. 

Alone at 1400- sunny- lighter wind- Secchi disk reads 15.0 feet. Surmise typical of this approximate water-clarity measurement. 

Collected 0-6 feet TP (acidified)- ChlA- orthophosphate- and silica samples.

Collected van dorn bottle samples at 15- 27- 35- and 43 feet for TP (also orthophosphate at 35 feet). 

Felt bottom around 50 feet...had drifted...so didn't collect 52' sample. 

DO/Temp profile- Secchi Disk- and Van Dorn profiles vertical- no drift during any of these even if the pontoon boat did drift somewhat southeast from start-to-finish of work (to a shallower location). 
10/16/2016,Regis Brost and John R. Gray- gorgeous/calm morning- Gray fishing boat. Zero drift and within 25' of "precise" center of deep hole based on DNR-provided coordinates. 

Used UW DNR Trout Lake Station HACH  HQ30D DO/temp meter SN 130300085407

Determined from DO/temp measurements that autumnal overturn has yet to take place. Opted to collect only 0-6' samples for TP (acidified)- orthophosphate- and silica- to be submitted with two 9/13/2016 Minocqua Thorofare 
samples via mail on 10/17/16. 

If samples collected later in 2016 (presumably by Regis Brost)- will be done to measure zero-temp-stratified waters
10/29/2016,Regis Brost alone on Fleming's pontoon boat...no samples collected because of stratification- however minimal- remains (sought to collect post-overturn 2016 samples). Records from Regis Brost keyed in by John R. Gray.

Temp/DO meter borrowed from Trout Lake Station- same instrument as  used here in 2016. 
11/17/2016,Regis Brost ferried to Deep Hole by ___________- used same Trout Lake Station DO/Temp meter as in all other Lakes Minocqua and Kawaguesaga measurements in 2016. 

This last set of 2016 samples that began in April represent a decadal "snapshot" of QW status of lake Minocqua. The last detailed Minocqua Deep Hole monitoring (in addition to the LTT monitoring by DNR that was taken over by John Gray and Regis in 2016) was by USGS in 2005-07. 

The Minocqua/Kawaguesaga Lakes Preservation Association is to be commended for funding most of the 2016 sample analyses (those in addition to standard CLMN monitoring in Lakes Minocqua and Kawaguesaga). 
06/01/2017,John R. Gray and Regis Brost- no DO/temp profiler but with Orion Model 122 specific conductance meter:
s/n 0910176- top 6'- temp = 15.4 C- specific conductance = 118.2 micromhos/cm
s/n 0910093- top 6'- temp = 15.4 C- specific conductance = 118.0 micromhos/cm

See Kawagasuega Deep Hole similar measurements
06/27/2017,By John R. Gray and Regis Brost after Kawaga CLMN measurements/sampling at 1645. As usual- used Trout Lake Station/UW DO/temp profiler HACH 30d s/n 130300085407- and two specific-conductance meters- both Orion Model 122- as follows:
s/n 0910176- temp = 19.5 C- SC = 116.1 micromhos/cm- at about 6' depth
s/n 0910093- temp = 19.5 C- SC = 115.8- ditto
This work done in quasi-support of DNR LTT program- given that DNR/Woodruff apparently performs this work monthly in 2017 (Regis and I "did" this and additional work for Minocqua in 2016). 
07/17/2017,John R. Gray and Regis Brost as-usual in John's fishing boat after CLMN work on Kawaga at 0815 today. As usual- used Trout Lake Station/UW HACH 30d DO/temp profiler- and measured specific conductance with jrgray Orion Model 122 meter (did not record which of two we used). 

Top 6 feet water column temp = 22.4 C- specific conductance = 114.3 micromhos/cm.
08/19/2017,John R. Gray and Regis Brost using Trout Lake Station HACH 30d DO/Temp profiler and Orion Model 122 specific conductance meter s/n 0910176- from John's fishing boat on gorgeous/mostly calm morning. See Kawaga measurements earlier today with same as above. 
09/24/2017,Temperature profile using standard CLMN profiler-on-spool- and near-surface (2' depth) specific-conductance measurement = 120.0 umhos/cm with Orion s/n 0910176- by John R. Gray and Regis Brost from Brost pontoon boat. 
10/08/2017,See 9/24/17 comments- more-or-less same situation. Orion specific-conductance/temp meter s/n 0910176 value = 120.6 umhos/cm near surface- air temp 17.4 degrees C- surface water temp 16.1 degrees C. Largest secchi depth reading = 20 feet (Regis- John always gets a lesser reading when doing this together) since we started CLMN monitoring in 2015-
