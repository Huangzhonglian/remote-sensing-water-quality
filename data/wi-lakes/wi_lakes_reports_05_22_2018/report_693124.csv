08/28/2017,Rainbow Lake was as bad as Taylor Lake- the succhi Disk read only 10 ft.- the water color
was a noticeable darker green.   The abuse by boats to big to be here- and the quantity of boats- and the number of rental pontoon boats with no place for all these people to use a bathroom is killing a natural treasure.  It breaks my heart that the DNR and the lakes Association are doing nothing to stop this.  When I moved here is 1963 these lakes were something so very special- no longer- humans are ruining them. Please do something to help keep our lakes alive.  Helps us Lake Association.  Help us DNR'  Rental pontoon boats are allowing in excess of 600 passengers to relieve themselves in our lake- several times a day.  Please stop this horrible pollution.
