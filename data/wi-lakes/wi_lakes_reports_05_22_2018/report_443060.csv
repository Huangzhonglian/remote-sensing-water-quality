Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
07/16/1979,Migrated from EPA STORET Legacy Database- originally reported by Wisconsin DNR    
06/11/1993,Most unusual experience: we were approached by a loon who was very anxious about the Van Dorn bottle he dived under the boat and went down to follow the secchi disk.    
06/22/1993,Cloudy with a bright sky.  The temperature is very warm at 80 degrees.    
08/10/1993,Temp 85 F- lots of boats and waves/wake from boats- etc.)    
08/11/1993,partly cloudy.  Honor to have with today- Vernon Buckheit Myers- Doctorate in Limnology- who works with the 
Environmental Protection Agency
09/15/1993,Had to use two different dates because of weather.    
10/06/1993,The temperature is 11 degrees C at 10 feet.  Measuring now depends on the weather- sun and wind.    
06/27/1994,Beautiful day- then a storm hit.    
07/20/1994,Blue sky (first in a week) cumulus clouds.    
07/28/1994,Pair of gulls- herring    
10/21/1994,Weather is very cold now- this will be our last grab for the season in 94.    
05/30/1995,Saw four small mouth bass at 4' depth.  Lake level: very high

09/27/1995,Immature loons.    
10/12/1995,Water dark.  Windy- difficult to hold boat.  Next year may sample with algae net and s-r counting.  Chamber for phytoplankton.    
06/25/1996,Baby ducks- mergansers.  Water rushing through outlet- erosion on some shores- sort of undercutting.  Is this due to wake of large boats   Large rocks are being put in.    
07/26/1996,Soaring eagles and two immature eagles.    
08/16/1996,Sea gulls (herring)- no wind- very clear- we need more live.
