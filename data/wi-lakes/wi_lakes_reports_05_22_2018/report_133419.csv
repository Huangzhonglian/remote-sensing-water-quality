06/08/2014,Warnings posted around lake for blue-green algae outbreak.
06/21/2014,Observations follow week of heavy rain. 
08/10/2014,Blue-green algae outbreak on lake. May be starting to dissipate- but west end of lake and Halfway Prairie creek (outlet flowing west) have significant algae.
06/30/2015,Water quality improved from last year. Invasive carp received rotenone treatment under the ice on March 3- 2015: http://dnr.wi.gov/news/releases/article/?id=3516
07/18/2015,More vegetation/weeds than previous years. Friends group planted native aquatic plants on July 11- 2015 in two areas along west and north shore.
08/02/2015,Water lilies- sedges- etc from July 11 planting are doing well.
08/20/2015,Lake vegetation has gradually disappeared from surface after highest density in early to mid-July. Herons appear to be fishing for newly stocked fish- also a kingfisher on the north shore. Herons and sandhill cranes are commonly seen this summer.
09/06/2015,Water still appears murky and green but is less murky and less green than any previous Indian Lake survey this year.
09/26/2015,User perception of water quality is about 3.5.
06/04/2016,Deepest secchi disk reading in several years. Water is noticeably much clearer. Great blue heron fishing at southwest corner of lake.
06/19/2016,Thick mats of curly-leaf pondweed on west end of lake- difficult to row boat.
07/04/2016,Two significant changes since last survey on June 19- 2016: major dieback of curly-leaf pondweed and decrease in water clarity. Bald eagle soaring over lake at 3 pm.
07/24/2016,Curly-leaf pondweed has completely disappeared from lake. This area received about 4 inches of rain in past 4 days.
08/13/2016,Flushed great blue heron on southwest shore of lake. Water quality appears to be lowest of the summer.
09/17/2016,Great blue heron on west end of lake. Several great egrets in eastern bay- one on west end. Friend swam in lake this morning and reported good water quality.
04/15/2017,For the Perception category it was difficult to decide between 3 (slightly impaired) and 4 (substantially reduced). If I had the choice I'd say 3.5- medium impaired.
04/29/2017,Help from Laura Cominetti. Wind picked up once on the lake- causing low swells.
05/14/2017,Last spring (2016) also the lake was clearer than usual. Curly-leaf pondweed and Eurasian watermilfoil have spread in the past two weeks.
06/11/2017,Geese (with goslings) and ducks on lake- and tree swallows over the water. Vegetation (duckweed- milfoil) out to 15 feet from shore. 86 degrees F and humid.
06/26/2017,For SECCHI DEPTH- clarity was less than 1/8 of a foot- thus 0 if rounded to nearest quarter. Lake very murky- strong algae smell- no longer much vegetation.

Under USER PERCEPTION OF WATER QUALITY- 4 is entered- but the actual value is between 4 (Would not swim but boating OK) and 5 (Enjoyment substantially impaired).
