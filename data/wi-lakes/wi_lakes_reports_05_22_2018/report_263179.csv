05/22/2006,Bright sun- lite breeze out of NW- lots of cottonwood catkins floating on lake- water flowing freely out of north notch- ice out completely on April 15
06/18/2006,Partly cloudy- strong NW wind- water flowing briskly from North notch.  Temperature probe gave error at depths greater than 60 feet.
07/16/2006,Partly cloudy- hot- practically no rain in last month but lake level is normal.
08/15/2006,Clear and windy.  Considerable rain has overflow going out North exit at a good rate.  Some point water cloudiness from runoff at new construction sites.
