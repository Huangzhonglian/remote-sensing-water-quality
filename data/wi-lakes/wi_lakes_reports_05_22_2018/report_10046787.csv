Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
08/06/2016,Sunny- low wind- 83 degrees
08/13/2016,Partly Cloudy.  Winds about 10mph. Dense subsurface macrophyte growth affected accuracy of measurement.  We took measurement at desired GPS reading- but the subsurface growth was so extensive that a open spot was not available anywhere near the desired location. 
08/25/2016,Sunny day - almost no clouds.  Light winds.  Found open water very near sampling site
07/20/2017,Sunny and warm.  Water appears green
07/27/2017,sunny- mild wind- 80 F
08/02/2017,Sunny- no wind
