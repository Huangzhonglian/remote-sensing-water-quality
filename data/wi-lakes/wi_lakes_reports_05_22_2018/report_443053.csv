07/30/2015,Air; 75 degrees- water: 78.2. Partly cloud w/ strong NW wind but not as strong as yesterday's 40+ winds. Both adult loons were banded earlier in the week. Both adults were found to have pieces of fishing line wrapped on one of their legs. These were removed by the loon banding teem. Let's hope the wounds heal and there will be no lasting issues for the loons. 
08/18/2015,Air: 62 degrees. Cloudy w/ NE wind. After a dry period- we had over an inch of rain two nights ago. The loon chick continues to grow

At least one loon (probably the chick- though she's far more grown up now) is still foraging on the lake.  Air: 51.8. Hazy sunshine w/E wind. A more seasonal day after two days of near seventies temperatures. At least one loon (probably the chick- though she's far more grown up now) is still foraging on the lake. Looking at the temperature and dissolved oxygen data- it appears the fall turnover is complete and Alva is ready for winter. See you in spring!
05/09/2016,Air: 51 degrees- H2O: 53. Cloudless day w/ brisk SE wind.
06/14/2016,Air; 59 degrees. Cloudy w/ E. wind. Recent rain with more in the forecast One loon foraging on the lake.

07/25/2016,Air: 72 degrees. Sunshine with strong WNW wind. Much recent rain- but today is a pleasant summer day. The loon chick continues to grow and it and the parents were recently banded.

08/29/2016,Air: 71 degrees. Rain earlier this morning but the sun is out now. More rain is in the forecast so the lake level will climb ever high ward. One of the loon parents and the chick were nearby as we sampled.  
09/02/2016,Air; 70 degrees- H2O: 71. Sunshine w/strong SW wind. Much recent rain coming two inches at a time has raised the lake level to a point where it is almost a foot higher than it was in May. 
09/29/2016,Air 62 degrees. Sunshine w/ N wind. After a day of rain- we finally have a wonderful early fall day however- fall colors have yet to arrive. Alva's young loon has had another immature loon as a guest the past two weeks. Additionally- as a sign the migration time is near- our resident adults have been joined by a third loon.  
10/19/2016,Air: 49 degrees- H2O: 57. Sunny w/SW wind. The lake level is up again after another storm that dumped 2+ inches of rain on the area. Two immature loons remain on the lake but- there was no sign of any adult today. With our dock awash- it's time to take in the boat and end our sampling for another year. 
06/01/2017,Air: 67 Degrees- Water: 67.2. Sunshine w/brisk NW wind. Finally a pleasant day after much recent rain. Alva's level is as high as we've seen it on our 50+ years on the lake. Much undercutting of higher unprotected shorelines from wind and boat created waves. Though or loon pair has returned- there is no sign of a nest as yet.
06/16/2017,Air 74: Degrees. Water temp. not taken. Sunshine w/ strong SW wind. Again- much recent rain and the lake level continues to rise. We have had a number of serious loon intrusions over the past few weeks.

07/16/2017,Air: 70.2 Degrees. Water: 70.4. Sunshine W/ light NW wind. A beautiful summer day. Finally- two sunny days in a row made for a fine weekend. As for Alva's loon pair- there have been two attempts at nesting- but no chicks have resulted.  Additionally- as the result an extended fight between two birds that we watched- it appears as our banded female has been replaced by a new female that is not banded.   
07/25/2017,Air : 67.5 Degrees. Partly cloudy w/ brisk SW wind. After a number of days with sunny weather- rain is again in the forecast! We've observed Alva's male loon foraging with the new female so it appears that he has accepted her as his new mate. 
08/12/2017,Air: 70.5 Degrees. Water: 71.3. Sunshine w/ light NW breeze. Severe undercutting of Alva's high shorelines has resulted in cloudiness in the water along those shores.   
08/29/2017,Air: 62.6 Degrees. Dead calm w/sunshine. A beautiful quiet morning. 
09/25/2017,Air 74 Degrees. Calm w/ high clouds an filtered sunshine. We have had two weeks of the warmest weather of the year but- change is in the forecast for tomorrow. At least two loons remain on the lake.      
10/06/2017,Air: 51.3 Degrees- Water: 60.8. Clear skies w/ SW breeze. A beautiful early fall day with fall colors finally showing. One  loon in immature plumage ( probably a fly-in from another lake ) and one mature loon remain on the lake.
