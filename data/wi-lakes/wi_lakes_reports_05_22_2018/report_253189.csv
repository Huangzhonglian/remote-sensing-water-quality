05/06/2006,clear- slight breeze- 73 degrees- colonies/small globs of algae - looks like Aphanizomen + Microcystis
06/02/2006,storms 1-3/4 inches rainfall in 15 minutes on 5/2/07- also rain on 5/28 and 5/30; floating globs of decaying blue-green algae- Oscillatoria
06/24/2006,cloudy- calm to slight breeze- collected bottom water has hydrogen sulfide smell- but not ambient air from downstream WQ
07/18/2006,clear- calm- 84 degrees
08/14/2006,few scattered clouds- calm to light wind- floating clumps of Oscillatoria (dark green/black filamentous algae common)- lot of algae filled zooplankton in net tows
08/29/2006,cloudy- calm- storm yesterday- water clearer in shallows- "storm" debris near dam; did shoreline survey for Eurasian watermilfoil- lots of healthy native plants for collective competition- but no EWM; floating clumps of filamentous blue-green alga Oscillatoria; bottom water slight musty- hydrogen sulfide smell- but not smell in air from stream below dam
09/16/2006,floating globs of dark filamentous blue-green alga Oscillatoria; wind SSE at 15 mph; skies mostly clear
05/20/2007,Overcast- 55- wind from E at 8 mph- tiny zooplankton in water
06/23/2007,75- slight breeze- overcast- 1.7 " rain + high wind in last few days- zooplankton abundant- not much suspended algae; sago pondweed becoming abundant out from landing into deeper water; flat-stem pondweed- water stargrass- a little Vallisneria- and some curly-leaf near pier at landing and some white water buttercup near shore.  Beautiful lake!
07/25/2007,Clear- hazy- 84- calm to slight breeze SW 5-10- clumps of floating Oscillatoria- tiny green algae colonies in water- some floating clumps of vegetation.  Near boat landing Vallisneria- Heteranthera- spiny naiad- slender naiad- curly-leaf pondweed- flatstem pondweed- sago pondweed- filamentous algae.  Lot of aquatic plants on trailer.  No zebra mussels on sampler- O EWM!
08/16/2007,Calm- overcast- 80- humid- more than 5 inches of rain since 8/4- more than 2 inches since; blue-green algae bloom- small round colonies; floating globs of Oscillatoria; aquatic plants (sago pondweed) to surface at 12 feet; no plants deeper than 12 feet.
