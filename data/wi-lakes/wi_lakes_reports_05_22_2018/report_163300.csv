10/14/1998,LAKE SAMPLE    
05/26/1999,Ice out 4/6/98.  Ice on 12/22/98.  Ice out 4/8/99.  Lake has not slept much for 2 years.    
10/05/1999,We had a lot of rain.  I believe the lake is stained more from the heavy flow of water flushing through the tamarack swamps thus the lower secchi depth.    
07/09/2001,SITE A-CENTRAL BASIN    
10/01/2001,Lake calm and covered with patches of green algae.    
05/28/2002,SITE A-CENTRAL BASIN    
06/25/2002,Water is very clear and clean.    
10/08/2002,CENTRAL BASIN    
10/08/2002,Surface is murky.    
06/04/2003,Alot of pollen in water
    
08/26/2003,Surface algae
    
05/18/2004,Surface temp. 59 F.    
06/28/2004,We are saddened to see areas of Eurasian Water Milfoil in the Flowage! This is the fourth summer we think it has been in the lake- but the first summer when it was so visible on the lake surface. We have known about it in the lake for just a year. Our lake association has studied the problem with grant monies but a way to control it hasn't been decided.    
07/29/2004,Surface temp. 74 F.    
08/30/2004,Surface temp. 68 F.    
10/12/2004,Surface temp. 58 F.  Volunteers use a GPS now so our locations are constant!    
10/11/2005,Particles of algae are visible at this site- and algae is thick near some shorelines. Swimming would not be enjoyable! Perception is impacted also in these areas. EWM is visible in more and more locations. The Lake Association has marked some areas of EWM to keep boaters from cutting off plants with their props. This has created a noticeable decrease in the EWM in the gates of the dam.    
06/24/2007,PERCEPTION - More boat traffic in this area might contribute to more floating weed particles today.
07/23/2007,Overcast
08/22/2007,Fog lifting- sun winking
09/25/2007,overcast- sun trying to find a peep hole
10/18/2008,Note to anyone who wonders how a beautiful lake can have a "murky" appearance. Flowage water looks murky when we look into the depths- but when we pull a sample out of the water it is perfect and clear!
05/04/2009,A beautiful spring day! Training with Dave Blumer for CLMN expanded monitoring tests and grant tests.
05/28/2009,Sunny- warm- picked up EWM treatment marker jugs
06/05/2009,Fluffy clouds
06/10/2009,Fluffy clouds; 1" rain two days ago
06/23/2009,Best Secchi reading that we can remember!
07/20/2009,Cloudy; last week we had only 50 degree weather and clouds
07/28/2009,Cloudy 
08/05/2009,Sunny- cool for early August
08/18/2009,Watched five eagles above an island - so many in one place was awesome!
04/28/2010,Ice-out on March 31st
05/04/2010,A 1st for the 10' Secchi reading!
08/24/2010,Tanin stain in water is so evident today. Is this because of rain- rain- rain causing alot of water moving through the Flowage 
09/22/2010,Overcast
05/11/2014,Hazy skies; dead battery in DO/Temp Meter
05/28/2014,Clear sky today
06/25/2014,Cloudy cool morning
07/18/2014,Cloudy and wavy
09/06/2014,10+ inches of rain in recent week - today is awesome blue sky - water is so brown with recent rains and runoff
07/25/2016,Heard eaglets in nest on north shore!
09/18/2016,Cotton cloudy day!
07/25/2017,An eagle was "king of the hill" on Sand Island - probably needing to get away from the noisy eaglets on Picnic Island.
