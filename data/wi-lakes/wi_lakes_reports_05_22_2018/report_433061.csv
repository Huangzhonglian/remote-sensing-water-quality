04/24/2010,Lake Temp 55f- Overcast with light mist-Winds calm- Numerous geese and one pair of loons present-Loons very inquisitive-swam within twenty feet of my peddle boat several times while I was gathering samples Additional water sample taken for lab test on hardness-Secchi disk sample taken from depth of 25 feet was still very visible- future lake samples will be taken at the maximim lake depth of 29 feet as soon as we find it with gps Secchi disk visable to 25 feet when it touched bottom. Deepest part of lake is measured to be 29 feet. 

Two water samples were taken and lab tested for hardness. The first sample taken from the lake provided a hardness reading of 142ppm or 8.3 grains per gallon. This sample also tested 7.5pH for acidity. The second sample taken from a deep water well which supliments the lake water tested 204 ppm or 
11.3 grains/gallon.
05/29/2011,Overcast Skies with no Wind Partial sample taken for secchi disk only.  Temp. = 62 degrees F. Overcast- no wind.
