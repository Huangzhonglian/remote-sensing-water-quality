Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
09/15/2007,Partly sunny- breezy- saw eagle- green heron- belted kingfisher.  Canadian geese and coots on Upper Spirit Lake.
10/06/2007,2" rain in the past week.  Very still day- partly cloudy.
10/16/2007,Rained most of the night.  Lake still has algae clumps (brown-green) floating in the water- but not as large or as completely brown as at their peak.
11/10/2007,Overcast but pretty bright.  34 degrees Fahrenheit.  Dusting of snow on downed trees.  No rain this past week.  No ice on lake.  Some wind with minimal waves.
05/25/2008,Largemouth bass protecting their nests toward the shallow end of the water.  Water level definitely up from last year.
06/14/2008,There's been a lot of rain.  Water level up -- can just see the top row of rocks in the rock bridge across the channel between Upper Spirit and Lower Spirit.  Saw loon.
06/15/2008,Bright sunny day
06/28/2008,Numerous tree swallows- last week too.

Multiple lilypads- more with yellow flowers than white.

Breezy- slightly choppy on the water. Numerous tree swallows- last week too.

Multiple lilypads- more with yellow flowers than white.  Starting to see some particulate matter in the water- esp shallow and around lilypad area.

Breezy- slightly choppy on the water.
07/20/2008,Overcast skies
07/28/2008,Regular loon activity on the lake this summer.  More weed growth along the edges- into the water (since water level considerably higher than last year).  Black bear near lake (yearling).
08/31/2008,Saw 4 green herons along the west side of the lake (dock there + downed tree (Garrison place).  All had adult plumage --   two pair- could not determine this.

Water level at this time is lower than earlier in the summer but not as low as last year.  Lake color did not turn green with algae as it did last year- although there are now some brown clumps of algae floating at the water surface.
09/20/2008,Still some scattered brown clumps of algae on lake surface.

We had boneset around the entire circumference of the lake this summer.
06/12/2010,Lake very low . . . drought the past six years.
