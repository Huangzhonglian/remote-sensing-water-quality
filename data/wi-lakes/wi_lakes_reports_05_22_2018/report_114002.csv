Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
08/15/1979,Migrated from EPA STORET Legacy Database- originally reported by Wisconsin DNR    
07/28/2016,Spiny waterflea sample was collected with Ekman dredge method. 5 aliquots examined; sediments were mostly very fine material that passed through the sieve.
07/28/2016,Water level visually assessed as high. Deep hole depth 7.7 feet. Water sample was taken by hand grab. Meter not calibrated before monitoring. Monitored at 43.54494- -89.10493.
08/11/2016, Depth at sample point 6.9 feet; DO meter not calibrated before monitoring. Sampled at 43.54527- 89.10390.
