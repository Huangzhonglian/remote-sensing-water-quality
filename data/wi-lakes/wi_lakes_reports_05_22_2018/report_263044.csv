06/25/1996,Lake vegetation growth seems late + slow this year. question if late (ice out) May have impact.    
07/05/1996,Vegetation growth continues to be slow. question if record and late heavy snow has increased the volume of runoff causing impact on water (darker). reported information. to great "96" secchi dip.    
08/02/1996,Vegetation growth (below normal) for same period of past few years. visible algae-little on surface-wind calm.    
09/03/1996,Light wind-readings consistent with previous reports. question remains. why  history shows they are lower than past years. what effect does record snows and late ice out have     
06/21/1997,Some wave action
