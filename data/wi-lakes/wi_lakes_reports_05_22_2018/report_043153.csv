Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
08/02/2011,The rainfall this year caused the lake to explode with aquatic plants - this made it easier to find the deep hole.  The lake is still very difficult to get out into - shallow mucky bottomw with very thick grasses out from shoreline.
08/25/2016,The lake is now trapping the dead and live vegetation along the shoreline.
09/04/2017,The lake level continues to rise- little or no lake activity.
