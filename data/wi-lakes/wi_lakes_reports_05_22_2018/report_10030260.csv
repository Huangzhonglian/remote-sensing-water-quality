05/18/2012,07/12/2012 - Checked Zebra Mussel substrate.  
05/18/2012,Partly Cloudy and Breezy. New Zebra Mussel substrate location is approximately 100 ft. southeast of the public launch.  Weather conditions at first check of substrate on June 19 was sunny and hot.  Air temperature was 93 degrees and water temperature at substrate was 82.9 degrees.  Lake water level has dropped since initial placing of substrate on May 18 but still in the normal range.  Surrounding area in need of rain.   Zebra Mussel sampler first monitored on June 19.  Please note the very top of the sampler was above water because of drop in lake level.  Sampler was re-set below water line.  New sampler location is 100 ft southeast of the public launch.  Weather conditions on June 19 were sunny and hot.  Air temperature of 93 degrees. Zebra Mussel sampler checked 08/27/2012.  Having trouble keeping upper substrate submerged because of low lake water levels.  Sunny morning with a slight breeze. 
06/01/2013,Nice morning.  Partly cloudy with a slight breeze.  Lake level has dropped approximately 8 - 9 inches.  Removed Zebra Mussel substrate this mornong. Partly cloudy with a slight breeze.  Nice morning.  Zebra Mussel substrate removed from the lake this morning.
