Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
06/13/1987,Sunny- windy- and lots of boats and skiers.    
06/27/1987,Sunny- windy- and there are no boats on the water.    
07/10/1987,Sunny and windy.  There are boats and skiers.    
07/26/1987,Windy- slight overcast- and the lake was rough.    
08/23/1987,Partly cloudy- sunny- windy- lake rough- no boats.    
08/08/2001,There are fish between 5ft and 12ft- some Eurasian water Milfoil fragments floating at surface- the pH at surface is 6.4- and it is hot and humid.  This shallower end of the lake was 2 degrees F warmer than the "deep hole." Ice on mid Jan. 2002    
05/31/2002,No traffic- surrounded by heavy growth of eurasian water milfoil- but none in sampling site.    
08/05/2002,Rexent light rain- little traffic (one fisherman). Weeds were cut last month. Fish between 5-8 feet. Some plant fragments    
06/25/2003,No visible milfoil or debris; cottonwood fuzzies on surface; fish between 5'-10'; no traffic pH 6.9.    
07/30/2003,Fish between 5' and 11'. Some plant fragments. Began raining heavily on "up" run; pH 6.9    
08/16/2003,Fish between 5' and 10' (mostly 6-9'). Plant fragments with some fresh sprigs of milfoil. pH 6.9    
09/01/2003,Satellite (landsat); fish between 6' and 10'. Some water ski activity. pH 6.5    
07/09/2004,Fish @ 6'-9'.  Evidently the spraying (9 days earlier) did not affect the North Basin - yet - (the Deep Hole had no D.O. the bottom 8'.).  Bottom temp. 67.3 F- bottom D.O. 0.25 mg/l.  Water level +4.5".    
08/11/2015,sunny calm
