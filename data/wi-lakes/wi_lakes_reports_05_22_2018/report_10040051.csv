09/30/2017,We are taking all boats out of water. This has not been a very nice summer. Our lake is 26 feet deep- we never touched the bottom this year. I'm thinking that because of all the rain- the lake was never clear enough. It seemed that we were always wet. I never used the sprinkler on the lawn all summer. Our lake is up 1 foot- 4 inches over last year.
