Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
07/26/2016,Alison was training Dick to do the next to sampling visits besides collecting data today. Dick will collect the data and samples in August and early September to be sent in with his regularly scheduled stream monitoring samples. This new deep hole site was determined during a PI earlier in the month. Lake Level was judged as normal visually.
08/08/2016,End time is estimated. Dick noted on data sheet that color was dark green and water level appeared normal. 
08/22/2016,Dick noted that water level was high due to 3" of rain in the last week. Depth at DH today was 8 feet. The water color circled was greet/brown. Jeanne entered as brown based on what she'd seen in the past on the lake for color- but could have been greener. Use perception was marked as 3/4.
