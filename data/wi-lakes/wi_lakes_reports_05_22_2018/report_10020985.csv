Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
04/28/2009,Placed loon platform- pair of loons already on lake.\
pH - 6.5
Macroinvertebrates collected:
mayfly larvae
pouch snail
scud
06/02/2009,Loon on nest- 2 loons present- defending nest - normal behavior- black flies present- 2 eggs
Students learned about invasive species as it is invasive species awareness month.  Learned about shoreland buffers and took transect of vegetation cover percentages (Canopy- Shurb- Groundcover) shoreline-upland.
pH - 7
04/26/2010,Sunny- slight breeze- 60 degrees- trees are budding some leafing out.  Ground is dry snow has been gone for about  a month.  Green grass already!  2 loons present.  Macro invertebrates collected include mayfly larva- whirligig beetle- caddisfly larva- midge larva- scud- back swimmer- pouch snail- daphnia and dragonfly nymph.
09/01/2010,Removed nesting platform- aquatic plants collected included soft stemmed bulfush- floating bur-reed- water celery- common bladderwort- whitestem pondweed- bushy pondweed- spadderdock.
05/04/2011,pH - 7.39
