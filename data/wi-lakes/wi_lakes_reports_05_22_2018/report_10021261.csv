08/10/2007,Clear bright sunny day- calm lake surface. Temperature and D.O. profile obtained with Hydrolab MiniSonde 4a generously loaned by Dr. James Cotner- Department of Ecology- Evolution- and Behavior- University of Minnesota.   Data entered for 08/10/2007 for readings from surface to 8.34 meters.  Data for rest of profile (8.8 to 16.04 meters) were entered for date of 08/11/2007 due to lack of reporting space for 08/10/2007.
