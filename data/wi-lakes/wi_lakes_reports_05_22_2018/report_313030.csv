06/06/2007,It was not the best test conditions being too windy.  Let out 35 feet of anchor.  Two weeks ago the lake was clear and now the lake is murky.  If the lake does the same as last year it will become clear again by August.  I would not want to swim in the current conditions.
06/13/2007,Anchor down 35 feet.  Excellent conditions for testing the water.  Water is still murky.
06/22/2007,Anchor down 35 feet.  Calm and sunny with water temp at 79 degrees.  Recent heavy rain of 2 inches.
06/28/2007,36 feet of anchor.  Water temp 81 degrees.
07/13/2007,The lake has a problem and needs chemical testing.  It is as bad as I have seen it in 22 years.  Reading was taken at anchor of 34 feet and 78 degrees water temperature.
07/30/2007,The lake is healing.  It is getting clear.  I even went swimming which I would not do before because of the way the water looked.  Anchor was down 36 feet and temp was 82 degrees. 
08/13/2007,34 Feet of anchor.  Water is 82 degrees and clear.  I can see some green bloom floating on the surface of the water but not much.  I expect the water will clear up even more to a depth of 10 to 12 feet.
08/30/2007,The lake is clear.  It looks like it has healed from the dirty look in June- and July.  Anchor was at 35 feet and water temp was 77 degrees.
